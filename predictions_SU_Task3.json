They were crying, too. \"I know you were just scared, \" said the teacher. She gave them a hug.",

i do. we were standing by the atm and getting money. i put my hands by where the money would come out, the money hit my hands and went inside. an innocent mistake, i didn't mean no harm.  \nbut you spent hours telling me how me my friends and relatives will suffer, because we're not gonna go to mc d's. because i fucked up and i didn't think it trough. everyone was so eager to go there, but now they will be hungry and have to eat at home, because it was all my fault. and oh i do remember the phrase to this day \"now how they will think of you\".  \n\ni hate that phrase, try saying it to a kid near me, and i'm gonna whoop your ass.\n\nofcourse, everyone knew it was my fuckup. it was my fuckup and no birthday party for me nor anybody. bad kid. you are inferior.\n\nit was always like this, you do something that she doesn't like you are inferior. not \"undisciplined\", inferior. remember? oh do you rememer when i showed you that i predicted a result of a scientific study? i was fucking twelve. but nope, it didn't matter. it didn't matter because bobby got an a in math while i had a b.  \n\nremember, in 4th grade, i asked you to buy me a new school bag. because all others had non-kiddy ones. remember? you said we didn't have money, you said mine was fine and i should study harder. that i should look at daniel, who lives with a single mother and wears second-hand clothes. look how he loves her. look how good of a kid he is, not you ungrateful brat.  \ni remember, i went to a shop and bought a $3 bag, which i used for the next 3 years.\n\noh do you recall what happened when i didn't want to go to my grandpas birthday? \"grandpa loves you so much, and you don't love him. you will upset him and he will cry\".\n\nand the whole \"i am older and your mom. and you're a piece of shit\". crap, i remember coming to a friends house and being in trance from seeing that his mom talked to him like an equal. i was shocked, it hit me like a truck. why, what. i didn't understand why in the fuck would a parent talk to his kid like an equal. it felt good, but, so unnatural. it never really dawned on me.\n\ncrap, do you remember my clothing? i had to walk like i was living in the 70's at grandmas, because it was \"cool\" you've said. we weren't poor. our poor relatives managed to go on a vacation abroad. we were making twice as them. we lived in a shittier apt, we wore shittier clothes and eat worse food.  \n\noh remember how you berated me, that i help my aunt with the dishes while i don't do them at home. that i'm an asslicker and don't love you? i didn't know then, i thought that i was indeed a bad person. i remember how the aunts family was always cheerful and treated others better. aunt talked to me, she was interested in my life. but i didnt know why i helped her. i wanted to help her, i loved spending time at her place.  \n\nand you know, money. to this day i can perfectly recipe all the accents in the phrase \"we dont have money\". you and my stepdad made a shitton of money, but we never had enough. never had enough to let me go somewhere with my friends. or wait, do you think it was accidental that i started drinking at 15? $3 got you drunk and made life better for 6 hrs. or why i wasted so much time at the computer? yeah, because it was cheap. because we never had money for me to go somewhere. when i took my first job at 15 you made me pay 30% of my salary for my martial arts class. also for the flat/food and transport faire. i'm a bad ungrateful kid you said, i stopped doing sports. i was home at midnight. and because i was making money, no fucking allowance. because we had no moooooneeeeeeeeeeey.  \n\nironic, that you always had money to go and drink cofee with friends, you always had money to buy buns at the shop. that bag of cookies? yup. oh you always had money for another \"eastern meditation\" guy. you know, his kids were better than me. oh, and all those eastern bullshit courses you visited. yes ofcourse we had no money. it didn't matter that my pc was dying (i can ressurect pc's easily now). it didn't matter that it caused me great grief. we had no money, because we were poor. but that indian guy helped you improve your chakra.\n\noh remember how you liked to remember that i'm a burden on you, and without you i will die. because whatever energy coming from you will stop? yeah i do. remember how you liked to count my money?  oh i do. i asked stepdad for $20 he gave me $40. welp, one week without an allowance. cos fuck you.\n\nmoney money money. it was always about money. look how poor that grandma is. look at her and see how she counts the pennies. see how bad others have it. but we have it slightly less worse. remember?

(which im told tests facial nerves.) \n\nas you can imagine through the course of 30 eye examinations, some of the students are going to make mistakes, and some are going to really fuck up, although as 3rd years i wasn't expecting too much to go wrong. \nsome of the major mistakes included asking me to read text in a standard size 12 font from 5 meters away with one eye closed, which even saying it out loud should sound ridiculous! some students forgot to wash their hands and some forgot to check my name and date of birth.\nabout 20 tests in the next student comes in, a very nice, very polite and energetic girl and she starts the exam off very well. about 2 minutes in she is about to start the whole flash light in the eye section, so she picks up the supplied light and starts to press the top. it dosnt light up so she then tries twisting it; pushing it again, pressing the lens in, tapping it off the table and all sorts when there was a very obvious rubber button on the side of it. \nat this point i lost it. i burst out in uncontrollable hysterics laughing at this poor girls misfortune. i was laughing so hard i could hardly breath and i suppose laughter is infectious as the student then also burst out in laughter! we (or rather i) proceed to unintentionally waste the remainder of the 6 minutes she had to complete the exam by trying to hold a straight face, which i failed horribly to do.\nSummary:  the hospital exam i worked at was not going as expected. a student was having some trouble with a piece of equipment and the other students were having",

(i realize she's a girl, but i don't care who you are: if you hit me, i will hit you back. big or small, guy or girl ) then i take my seat back thinking it's over; nope. she picks up a glass and chucks it at me striking me in the face again. so what do i do? i got up and smack her across the face hard enough to send her into the next room and onto the ground (once again, open handed. i didn't punch her). this is followed by about 4 security guards tackling me, picking me up, and carrying me down three flights of stairs and out of the club.\n\nnow, i wouldn't say i was out to hurt this girl after she attacked me out of nowhere, however i wasn't going to back down either. she hit me once and i retaliated by hitting her once back each time. i could have gone after her and really hurt her, but that was more than necessary at the time. after i hit her the first time, i sat back down which is when she threw a glass at me and hit me in the side of the face. then i got up and hit her again, and after seeing her fall into the next room, i was immediately tackled by the security guards and whisked out. \n\ni would just like to know, how do you feel about hitting someone else? did i really react inappropriately or was i justified in my actions? i grew up with some messed up history and always told myself to never hit a girl because of witnessing domestic abuse first hand, but at the same time i was also raised to stand up for myself and defend myself the same if it was a guy or a girl. i don't take crap from anyone and i'm sorry, but if you're a girl and you hit me, expect to get hit back. there are no double standards as far as assault goes in my book. and by the way, i have a nice lump on my jaw from where the glass struck me. i'm not sure about her, but i'm pretty sure she has a good hand print on her face.\n\ni do realize that we were all a little drunk and there's the reality that i could have handled the situation differently, but i also realize that i reacted the same way i would have if i was sober. don't go attacking someone and expect them to just sit there and take it.\nSummary: ently, it seems that the speaker was involved in a scuffle in which the narrator was on the receiving end of a thrown glass. this caused the",

i chose to be an electricians mate and bootcamp was going by slowly, i wasn't craving drugs so much as i was just very bored with how slow everything moved. i had expected a lot more pt and a lot less sitting around everywhere we went listening to the next guy in the days schedule. towards the end of bootcamp we got into a lot of marching and unfortunately my voice would do this weird dinosaur shrieking sound after maybe 30 minutes as it started to kick the bucket for the day. i always felt bad for the poor souls who were around me in my division when the inner dilophosaurus in me would come out, it really was excruciating.\n\nenough about bootcamp though, i made it through and was now in my schooling to become an electricians mate. shit it's 8 hour classes all day mostly on the computer. i did my part for the first week, sat on the computer all day going through the motions. now the fuck up begins. on my 2nd week of schooling the instructor releases us for the lunch break and i am done with the day, fuck this shit. my mind wanders to a time i was smoking weed with 2 friends and they had talked about drinking cough syrup.. i've always been in great control when i did heavier drugs like acid or ecstasy, at least in enough control to play it cool. know where this is going? i got the brilliant idea to drink cough syrup on the lunch break and just buzz through the 2nd half of the day. at the store and with little knowledge on 'robotripping' i decide to pick the cough syrup delsym. they only had the small bottles and i'm 6'1 190lbs.. surely that wouldn't be enough for me. i purchased 2 of the small bottles of delsym and put them back like shots before returning to class.\n\nabout 30 minutes into class and i'm still not feeling anything except for a stomach ache, what a bust... then it hit me and oh my god did it hit me. the only way i can think to describe what happened next is by comparing my experience to the sims. i was looking down at myself as if i were a sims character. i felt like i was a hollow log with a strong breeze blowing through me. there was a girl sitting next to me who i had gotten to know the first week. i don't remember her name and i only knew her last but lets call her amy for the sake of the story. i think amy liked me and i consulted with her what i had done, i wasn't making it out of this by myself and i pleaded for help.\n\nin my early stages of this trip i remember amy being concerned, the next thing i knew class was over and she was helping me get outside for the march to the theater. i'm still looking down at myself walking at this point but with amy's help i make it into the marching group. i forget why we were going to the theater but everyone on base was going. as my unit was marching (it was 3 wide on sidewalk) the sidewalk hooked to the right. as the marching group went right i kept going forward mindlessly into the road with cars driving. amy was able to recover me quickly and     i think a few people were like wtf?\n\nfast forward to the theater and i'm in a seat, my vision has changed i'm looking out of my eyes now! i have a very strong tunnel vision and i'm still very much tripping but i'm in a better state now. i did it, i fucking made it i'll be able to sit an hour or two through this and i'll be good to march back. 30 minutes go by and i'm confident i'm going to make it through this when a petty officer approaches me and tells me to come with him. fuck why does he want me to go with him. as i stand up to follow my body is moving like i'm a fucking robot. i start following him high kneeing the shit out of every step. it's not that i thought i was marching, it's that i forgot how to use my body and that's the best i could come up with to move forward. i follow the petty officer to a white van and we get in. over the next 20 minutes or so i'm wondering where we are going.\n\nwe arrived at a hospital, okay i can play this off maybe they think i'm just sick. walking into the hospital we go to talk to a lady behind a counter and she asks what's wrong with me. i tell her i'm just not feeling well but i'll be fine. as i say that i drop my uniform jacket, i bend over to pick it up and lose balance and fall on my face. i was helped up and escorted to another counter where a lady had documents she told me to sign. i tried to read it but that wasn't happening so i attempted to sign it. i haven't struggled that much with a pen since i was in the 1st grade, and my signature reflected that. the next thing i know i'm in a bed and they are asking me to pee into a bottle. jokes on them, i read that dxm (the main ingredient in cough syrup) doesn't show up on a drug test and that was the only active ingredient in delsym. they knew though.. i don't know how it happened but they sent some psychological wizard my way and somehow she probed that i did all those drugs in high school and i was on cough syrup at the time / hated the schooling and how it was'so fucking boring'.\n\ni remember after that being escorted back to the van and being taken to a new building. i wasn't sure what it was and was still tripping. after that i remember being told to dress into a robe that opens in the back and put into a room with some plastic bed built into the ground, it looked like a rectangular block. there was a 2nd plastic bed block in the room with someone sleeping in it. \n\ni still wasn't sure where i was and laid on that block for what seemed like hours. finally my eyes opened and it was the following day. the person sleeping was now awake and standing by the door. it was an old guy, quite large with the back of his robe wide open for me to gander. next thing i know i'm sitting in a room full of that same plastic material with some 8 or 9 others. i'm sitting on my plastic chair looking around when it hits me.. i'm in a mental ward. god damnit! they kept me there for 2 or 3 days, had me speak to 5 or 6 people, i'm assuming a few of them were lawyers, i only talked to the one medical lady in a white jacket at the other end of the table. they came to the conclusion that i wasn't fit for the navy and my recruiter shouldn't have recruited me to begin with. flash forward a week and i'm talking to the main guy on the base (i don't remember his rank) and he oh so kindly put it that i was on my way out. the separation process took over a month and i was moved to a building where others were waiting to be separated. oddly enough we still had the privilege of leaving the base with the same curfews as the other e1,e2,e3's. during the separation process i was robo tripping 3 or 4 times a week at the chicago mall (only one small bottle this time) and became quite addicted to it. i was able to get 3 people to robo trip with me over the course of the separation and 2 of them did it quite often. by the end of it i received an entry level separation, they got me out in 5 1/2 months and the deadline for that separation was 6. it wasn't honorable but it wasn't dishonorable. i also received an re-4 on my dd214 so i checked the military off my future career list. the robo tripping went on to cause me another very major fuck up after i re entered the civilian life before i was finally able to get my shit together. all in all life is good now, i haven't touched drugs in 3 years and was able to put my addictive personality to use with running.\nSummary:  i took cough syrum and had a bad trip, went to mental hospital and dropped out the Navy. \n",

not all kids look like their parents.\n\nanyway, i kinda sat on it for a few hours, just going over the few scraps of paper in this folder, then finally decided to go find my sister. she had left at one point, but my mom was puttering around in the kitchen and saw me come in with the stack of photos and this folder. i figured it wouldn't hurt to ask her - we were family, and we loved each other. it didn't matter if i was adopted. she was my mother, the only one i knew and cared about, i loved her, and nothing would ever change that. \n\nso i showed her the folder, and asked if i was adopted.\n\nomg. she looked at the folder, and burst into tears. i reached out to give her a hug, and she just sat down and started talking about 'poor mikey'. i am not mikey, or michael, or mike. apparently she and dad had a son when they were first married named michael. when michael was 4 they went to a park miami, where they had been living. michael somehow got away from her and was hit by a car. she told me how she was so devastated, and my father was too, but he had insisted that they go and adopt a baby. she hadn't wanted to replace their son, *like a dog*, (her words) but he had been so insistent she had finally given in and i had been adopted out of alabama. she told me how it was so hard to learn to love me at first, but when my sister had been born almost a year after my adoption she felt like she could be a mother again and accept me. \n\ni... was stunned. i asked her if she had taken her medication, because i couldn't believe what she was saying. i had been adopted as a baby, but she was insinuating there was almost a year when i was like the annoying house cat my father insisted on and she put up with because she loved him. she told me i could never replace mikey, but i 'came into my own' as i got older 'like a real son'. she sat sobbing at the kitchen island for a good half hour while i puttered around the rest of the house, packing up dads stuff. my sister came back and immediately asked me why mom was all haggard and weepy in the kitchen. i gave her a basic run down, but she didn't believe me and went to talk to mom herself. hour later, she's all weepy, helping me pack up stuff. she asked if i was ok. i said yeah and left. \n\ndidn't talk to my mother for a few days. my sister called me to ask about our arrangement - where i would move into moms house and she could get back to her own family. i had been staying in a hotel since the incident. i told her i didn't know, and she seemed shocked that finding out i was adopted would make me turn on mom. i tried explaining that no, it wasn't the adoption, it was the weird 'you weren't really my son' vibe i was suddenly getting. was i over reacting? maybe. so i worked up the nerve to call mom and ask if i could come over. she seemed surprised i felt the need to ask. i went over and she had a little lunch ready for us. we sat down... and she proceeded to tell me what a weight i had taken off her chest. she was all smiles telling me how now that i was older and it was all out in the open, we could start over and get to know each other as friends. \n\nwhat? what?!?!? who the hell is this woman?! \n\ni couldn't afford my own place at the time so i did move in with her, but it was beyond weird. really too much to go into, but imagine all those motherly touches you expect at your mom's house are suddenly gone. she really went from a mom to a roommate trying to be my best friend in a weird creepy way almost overnight. she quietly insisted i call her by her first name. first time my sister heard it she flipped her shit - until mom told her that she had asked me to do it.\n\nmy sister eventually witnessed enough weirdness she said she wanted to talk to mom about it. this was almost a year out for me, so i begged her to wait a few more months but didn't tell her that i had almost saved up enough for a down payment on a little house across town. i was just suddenly feeling so unwelcome, it was almost like mom had died. when she finally did ask mom why she was acting this way towards me mom tried to placate her and tell her that it was alright, that i was a grownup and was comfortable with our arrangement. i'm ashamed to say it felt really good to say no, it wasn't ok, and tell her i was moving out. right there. she looked all confused and asked why, and i just left. i came back over the next week to get my things, and she cried each time and told me if i left she would loose the house. i was really torn until she told me she wouldn't be able to find another roommate before the mortgage was due. \n\nmom lost the house, but i made it clear she couldn't live with me and my sister said the same. she moved into a crappy little singles apartment, and i want to feel bad but i can't. she stopped talking to me all together but my sister says she tries to call her all the time, and has told her husband that i was an ass and ruined the relationship between her and her daughter. i'm still pretty upset but really have only myself to blame for asking her about the folder. \n\n \n\nedit: thanks a lot you guys. you're really some warm people. i really do feel a lot better that there are people who get the whole mom gestures thing. it's so hard to describe to people without feeling like i was demanding to be treated like a little kid again and that wasn't what i meant. you guys are awesome. \n\nedit 2: thank you again you guys, so very very much. i'm off to work and wanted to let you guys know i had meant to post this as a 'crazy, right?

remember how i said i had no functional strength? i'd never done a standing press in my life, or lifted anything like that over my head, especially while drunk as hell.\n\ni dropped this girl flat on her ass from a good 1.8 metres high onto concrete. the slap she made when she hit the floor sounded to me like what thunder sounds like to an astraphobic. it was horrific. you know that moment where you sober up instantly. regardless of how wasted you are, all your senses suddenly spring to life again, and you realise you've done something horrific.\n\nas i'm stood there in shock, her friends come over to assess her. she was mildly concussed. i looked over at my buddies, and indeed around the bar, where everyone was stood mouth open. i felt horrific. like the weight of a thousand wrong-doings had just crashed upon me like grace had crashed upon the floor.\n\ni ran out the bar and sobbed my way home out of pure pure embarrassment. \n\nanyway i managed to get an apology in, but i never really associated with her again after that.\n\nthe moral of the story is - if you're going to lift weights, lift them properly! and don't ever try and impress a girl when your drunk, but thats a given i'm sure.\n\n \nsocial retard with girls, isolation exercises only in the gym, put imbalanced muscles to work for the first time by lifting a girl up in a bar, drop her flat on her ass\nSummary: 8.4 I am the moron, we are the narrator. \"We are now going into the life and the lift of my weight. \n",

would any of my friends get to adopt them? what would they look like?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\ni ran out into the living room and grabbed my mother, excitedly dragging her back into the room. heart racing and girly hormones a'tremble, i looked at the five little hamster babies, joy spilling out of my uterus. but then...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n...my heart dropped into the pit of my stomach, falling straight out my butt and onto the floor. what happened was indescribably horrific; that hoebag hamster, pupu, changed my entire concept of life as i knew it, and her actions would forever alter the way i thought about owning a pet any less intelligent than a house cat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\npupu reached over, and without any hesitation, stuffed one of her babies into her mouth. my eyes widened. she bit it right in half, snacking on the hamster's face as unenthusiastically as a fat guy on a couch eats a bag of cheetos, watchin'  the game.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nbefore i burst out into a fit of uncontrollable sobs that would last for minutes, pupu managed to eat several of her babies while pipi chilled in the top corner of the cage, probably thinking something like, 'dumb ho said she was on the pill!'\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nturns out, hamsters eating their young is a really common occurrence. when it happens to a teenage girl's married hamster couple, it's a little more dramatic than it sounds. but that's the truth of it. the mother hamster will eat them either due to shock and fear, or having a lack of resources in her body. apparently, pupu was freakin' anemic or some shit, because none of her litter survived.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nafter that, i was absolutely scarred. i caught pipi, once again, trying to mate with pupu, likely thinking something like, 'hey, she dumb, but she hawt!' i couldn't take it. so i gave pupu away and kept my rapist teddy bear hamster, the father to five deceased children, cannibalized by their own mother, ultimately, pipi's now ex-wife.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nthe good news is that pipi lived out a normal, healthy life. he died of old age. and i will never, ever, ever have a hamster again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nedit: front page?! so excite! much happy! wow! :d\nthank you redditors for all the support. i really appreciate all the lovely comments about your lulz, and my writing style. really, like, you have no idea how...how much i...oh god it's happening again ~joy seething from uterus~\n\n&nbsp;\n\nps. i was a dumb 16 year old at the time (redundant statement.) i am much more pet savvy now and believe research should be done before getting a pet. i also have a kitty who was abused by her former owner, and now she is happy. and no hamsters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nedit 2: thanks, everyone, for telling me your stories too! there were so many replies i couldn't respond to most of them. but i did go through and read everyone else's traumatic experiences. it seems everyone, including myself, thought we just had some crazy experience which actually turned out to be super common! nature is daaark, man.  i also appreciate the advice, like getting a bigger cage, or putting some meat next to the mother when she has her babies. ultimately, i learned that hamsters are solitary, and that a lot of people (like some derpy 16 year old girls) just don't know the best way to house them in order to prevent this stuff from happening.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nso, thanks again! i love having friends, so if you see me on teh subredditz, wave!\nSummary: es, please, hi! :) i, \nQuestion: I am writing a blog post on hamsterters. &nbsp;\nQuestion  How",

(i did get a whole van row to myself though.)\n\nwhen we finally got back, i got the dad of one of the kids on the trip (who happened to be a doctor) to take a look at me to see what he thought about them, and he said that i should be fine as long as we kept them bandaged up. \n\nnormally, this would be the end of a story like this, but we had a vacation planned that happened directly after the trip to destin, florida. the doctor dad from earlier said that near the end of the trip it would probably be ok for me to go in. \n\nhe would have been right if it weren't for one small detail. a detail that we didn't know about until the day we left for home. \n\nthere was flesh eating bacteria in the water. \n\nthat had already killed 4 people. \n\nin the same part of the beach i had gone in. \n\nnow as you can tell by reading this post, i am still alive. the bacteria did not infect me, and all that is left are two black scars on my knees. \n\nhere's some pics of the wounds (warning:very gross):\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/etus3a6pp/e3093_a5_f_63_db_472_f_a7_aa_c98_b705_db724.jpg\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/phyj24got/3_ad076_d3_be3_c_4801_b765_f967_c6_f18506.jpg\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/rnxfad9j1/dd6_c4_f6_b_6_ea1_407_c_9_ba5_9_de81_baf5_f53.jpg\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/lbia0j6gt/eb396945_52_e2_4923_a0_b5_6_fe6_b25_b12_b6.jpg\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/ygxs6n0cd/91_af6_f5_b_3890_4027_9_aca_afc177_efc97_a.jpg\n\nhere is what the scars look like now:\nhttps://s7.postimg.org/662vas1mj/img_4704.jpg\nhttps://s7.postimg.org/v0md4umgr/img_4705.jpg\n\n \n\nedit: fixed a typo\nSummary:  The narrator and his friends went on an ill planned bike trip where they got hurt. \n",

(fuck me, right?) this then allowed the possibility of accidentally sleeping in before my shift. which of course happened. i was a full hour late getting there. i apologized profusely, did my best work without using the box crusher, put in an extra hour of paid work, then volunteered on my own time right up until the stored closed to make sure everything was perfect, and i made sure my manager knew it. \n\nsunday rolls around. the day they post the schedules. i go in to check it, and i'm not on the schedule at all. my row of hours is completely just missing. he's really busy and a bit scattered so he's bound to make a mistake at some point right? so i go and talk to my manager about it. \"oh yeah i just made that in two minutes, when do you work next? thursday? i'll talk to you about it then.\" it? something he can't talk about now? sounds suspicious, but ok. thursday rolls around. yup, that's today. keep in mind that it's already too late to change next weeks schedule because it's only 2 days until the schedule for the week after is due. so i work, do my best and all that, but my manager says nothing about it and is acting kinda weird around me. so i mention it to him. \"oh ya, sorry [blah blah blah, i forget what he said because the way he said it made me super stressed that something was gonna happen] why don't you come in for three hours on saturday? any time between 8:00am and 4:30pm. as long as i'm here. you know what? just come in at 12:00 for 3 hours.\" \n\nthis is where i'm at. i don't think my girlfriends mom ratted me out, but is possible due to the fact that she super serious about being in control of 4 cashiers. and i'm pretty sure that i made up for sleeping in, i mean it's the second time i've ever been late! but on saturday my manager for sure doesn't need any extra help, let alone help for only 3 hours. looks to me like i'm gonna get fired. which normally wouldn't be *that* big of a deal, but this store is the only job i can get within reasonable distance of my house and i need work experience, a good reference, and a car to get to my next job up. i'm pretty fucked as far as i can see. why else would i go in for 3 hours?\n\n \n\nupdate: i got fired. fuck. but it was nothing that i had expected. the employees bathroom is a shit stained mess plastered in graffiti. some recent \"art\" contained a ton of swearing in it. half sarcastically i wrote below it \"watch the language please\" and my employer found that it matched my other printing. i straight up told the truth about it and he didn't care to give any second chances.\n\nso basically i got fired for asking my coworkers not to swear\nSummary: ing to work at this grocery i have to go to a grocery in a town 20 minutes away to do a job that pays better, has more",

good effect!\n\n\nhowever, my moment of \"victory\" was abruptly cut short by the sound of brakes locking up and tires squealing to a sudden halt. **\"errrrrrrrrkkkk!\"** it was like somebody pulled the needle off the record and everything snapped back to reality. oh shit....the car stopped! beth and i get small, crouch down out of sight and wait for the car to drive off, like the others that stopped before. not this one. \n\noh shit.....is that a car door? yes, that's a car door slamming shut. this is not good. we crouch down even more and did our best to stay still and absolutely quiet, keeping our ears open and listening for anything other than the idling car engine and the occasional wind through the trees. a voice in the distance broke the silence. a man.....probably in his 40s, i would guess. the exact words he used escape me now, but put it this way - he knew what had happened and he was rather pissed off. bits of the monologue included *\"what the fuck\", \"who do you think you are?\", \"i know you're down there\".* i swear, with the amount of rage that this guy was letting off, you'd think he'd had the worst day ever. maybe he did and my well placed snowball was the icing on the cake that sent him over the edge. who knows. all i know, is that this guy was blowing a gasket and the situation was looking bleaker by the second.\n\n\nbeth and i stay quiet, hoping that he'll abandon his search and return to his car. our hearts were racing and the tension in the air was so thick, you'd probably need a jackhammer to break through it. the voice is getting closer. shit........we had no exit strategy. stupid, stupid, stupid! we start backpedaling slowly, putting ourselves into position to escape if we had to. then.....as if on cue, we were greeted by the sounds of rustling brush and snapping tree limbs fairly close by. \n\n\nmotherfucker..........\n\n\nwe have contact.\n\n\n*oh fuck! oh fuck! oh fuck! oh fuck!* these are the thoughts running through my head as i realize that this guy is now crashing through the treeline towards our position, hollering and hellbent on revenge. well kids, this ends the stealth portion of our mission. beth grabs me and we take off into a sprint, running for our lives and dodging trees like luke on a speeder bike in the forest of the endor moon. this motherfucker is chasing us! where are the ewoks when we need them? those furry little bastards can show up at any time now! \n\n\nadrenaline is coursing through my veins and i'm looking back as we're hauling ass out of dodge, trying to get a glimpse of our pursuer. beth gracefully clears a low lying tree branch in our path. i try to follow suit and like a typical horror movie cliche, i trip over it, bust my knee and go tumbling ass over teakettle. what perfect timing. did i mention there's an enraged lunatic chasing us? yup, here i am, struggling to get up, while some asshole with presumably-bad-intentions - is gaining on me. this is turning into a shitshow real quick.\n\n\nthe pain in my knee subsides just enough to where i can muster up the strength to get back on my feet. i end up hobbling and hopping until i'm fully mobile again, then i break into a run. the hollering of expletives and rage become more distant as i dash the rest of the way through the trails back to my house. huffing and puffing, me and beth are just standing there, looking at each other with a \"wtf just happened?\" look. no more sounds of hollering and rustling in the trees. either the lunatic gave up and let us run, or we lost him. to be safe, we got the fuck in the house and stayed there, in case he came driving through, looking for us.\n\n\nbeth and i still laugh about that story to this day. but that was the last time i ever threw a snowball at a car in mischief.\n\n\n \n\nedit: it was endor moon - not dagobah - in which the speeder chase i referenced, had occurred. brain fart.\nSummary:.

so over the course of an hour, we load up on drinks and food, ranging from chocolate to weird foreign candy that none of us had ever heard of. when we finally finish our spree, we've spent more on candy then we did on marijuana, and it is now past our driving curfew. i suppose now is a good time to mention that i am 17, friend 1 one is 17, and friend 2 is 16, all of us have or license but we are in a single car.\n\n\nthen, we fucked up.\n\n\nbad.\n\n\ninstead of deciding to go to a basement of one of our houses, we figure that we might as well go to the small dirt pit, **next to a public library**. you couldn't see the pit from the road, as it was about 10 meters below street level, however this also means that **we** couldn't see the road or any cars coming on it; essentially we were blind to seeing any incoming cars until it was too late. anyways, we pull into the pit, and hide the car against the wall in case we needed to make a *\"get-away\"*. what a joke.\n\n\nbeing amateurs, we had decided that using metal pens would be the best way to smoke the pot, and we bought some from the local store. now, if you can imagine three guys, crammed into a car, dissembling a pen, and trying to stick a clump of weed in, you have a pretty good idea of what we looked like. eventually, we get everything in place, and friend 1 decides to take the first hit. as he begins to light it, i took a closer look at the bottom of the pen, **it was fucking plastic**. instead of smoking the drug, we were instead about to inhale toxic plastic fumes thinking that we could get high. i point this out, and a collective moment of stupidity envelops the car. after trying various other designs, i manage to macgyver an empty bottle of monster into a functioning pipe. cut a small hole near the bottom of the can, break the plastic off the pen, stick it into the hole, put the marijuana in the can, screw the lid on, warm the bottom, and suck through the hollow plastic. to be fair, in that moment i was pretty proud of myself.\n\n\nso finally, we start to get it going, we can taste a little bit of it. so we're passing this can around, tasting this foreign smoke, and just as it starts to smoke--\n\n\n--the unmistakable headlights of a police-issued chevy camaro turn into the pit.\n\n\n**fuck.**\n\n\ni point this out to both of my friends, instantaneously i knew how badly we had just screwed up, i'm sure they did too. when your first encounter with a cop entails the possession and usage of an illegal drug, you want to run like hell, you want to never come back, but i am so glad none of us chose to do that.\n\n\nthe car comes to a slow stop in front of us, no light-bar on but just bright-ass headlights. gradually, the officer walks over to our car, mag light in hand. the first words out of his mouth,\n\n\n\"alright, where's the dope?\"\n\n\nfriend 2, who was in the driver's seat says that he doesn't know what the officer was talking about, but that didn't last long. the smell was pungent, we knew it and the officer knew it, he made it very clear,\n\n\n\"i can smell it, where is it?\"\n\n\nf2 gave up, he reached over f1 (who was in the passenger seat), retrieved the small bag and handed it to the officer standing outside. by this point, a second officer (officer 2, or o2 if you will) had arrived and made his way over to the car.\n\n\no1: \"so what were you guys using to smoke this?\"\n\n\nfriend 2 holds up the can of monster, and i shit you not, **officer 2 starts laughing**. i mean shit, i could even see officer 1 smirking.\n\n\no2 (still chuckling): \"you guys are new to this aren't you?\"\n\n\nin some way, shape or form we all responded yes. up until this point, i was almost sure we were getting arrested, so i had refrained from saying anything. but now, it was almost like a lighter mood had come in. we're all profusely apologizing, commenting on how stupid we were, then officer two notices the bags of food in the back seat next to me.\n\n\no2: \"you guys watch dumb and dumber too much and think you were going to get the munchies? you're supposed to get the food after you're high.\"\n\n\nhe's literally laughing his ass off at this point, maybe because we were novices, maybe because it was the start of his shift, but he was laughing. the chat between us and the officers would be too long to type, but it was was as light and funny as a conversation between two friends. officer 1 runs all of our licenses, and returns to the car.\n\n\n\"you guys are good kids, you really screwed up, not only do you have illegal drugs in the car, but you're breaking curfew and *his* curfew for simply being out in the town is about to be up.\"\n\n\nhe pointed to friend 2, in our town if you are 16 you must be home by midnight, you can't even be walking around.\n\n\nanyways, he tells friend 2 to call his parents to come pick us up, since we were all sleeping at his house and couldn't drive ourselves home. both of them tell us that they won't tell friend 2's parents that we had marijuana in the car, but that we were just out past curfew, he even suggests that we spray the car down with cologne if we have any to try and mask the smell. officer 2, who had been standing tells us that we can put all of our food and bags into the trunk. well, at this point, about 12 bottles of gatorade that we had bought from the gas station were out of sight on the floor. so as i begin to hand what seems like an endless stream of gatorade to friend 2, both of the officer start laughing again.\n\n\nwhat could we do, they were on sale for $3/2.\n\n\nanyways, friend 2's dad finally arrives, not exactly in the best mood but we couldn't care, we weren't getting arrested and none of our parents knew that we just dodged the charge of drug possession. the night that followed included us sneaking out to laden the car with aerosol fresheners and hand-held vacuums.\n\n\ni don't thinking i'm going to try marijuana again for quite some time.\n\n\n \n\n\ni'm sure they're sitting at the station now, telling everybody how they caught kids trying to smoke weed out of a monster can with a pen.\nSummary: ingram.com\n",

 i had momentary visions of my everlasting fame in medical textbooks.\n\ndiscovering that old quasimodo had developed a hunchback was rather shocking, as nothing like this had ever happened down there before, nor did i have any reason to expect that it would, being a happily and faithfully married man.  i opted to try to make it through the workday.  meanwhile, quasimodo was sending me ever more frequent reminders that there was \"trouble on the border.\"  i was also getting dizzy and generally feeling absolutely crappy, so in the mid-afternoon i left early and went to the urgent care across the street.  these folks have always done a good job when i have visited them before, so i was sure they'd be able to help.\n\ni walked through the door.  the receptionist greeted me and asked \"what brings you here today?\"  i was about to answer when i noticed the tv news crew!  nope, not kidding.  i managed to come in just as a news crew was filming a segment for the 10 o clock news about the urgent care facility and the sudden uprise in respiratory illnesses after the thanksgiving holiday.  i could faintly hear the laws of probability laughing hysterically at me.\n\ntaking no chances, i told the receptionist i was there for a cough, and other reasons that i'd explain later.  in the back room.  when there wasn't a tv camera pointed in our general direction.  not too long afterwards, i was in an exam room, speaking to a nice nurse about both my persistent cough, and quasimodo's predicament.\n\n\"let's deal with the cough first\" she said.  i had no objections.  turns out i had a sinus and ear infection.  that would explain the dizziness and general craptastic feeling of exhaustion all day.  she said she'd prescribe antibiotics, then said \"now, let's check out the other problem.\"\n \nfeeling somewhat awkward, i stalled for time.  \"so, i should just... uh...\"\n \n\"yep.\" she said.\n\ni dropped my trousers, and the nurse took a look.  then she grabbed quasimodo and positioned him for proper viewing of the afflicted area.  the infection was nastier and more horrifying than ever.  \"wow, that's pretty big.\" she said.  being a well-bred and respectful man, as well as being pretty much totally at her mercy, i declined to make the obvious comment here.  besides, we both knew she was talking about the lump.\n\n\"hold that thought, i'm going to get the doctor,\" she said, and whisked out of the room.  i stood there for a moment, thinking \"wow.  the nurse just called for backup!  that can't be good, can it?\" \n\na few minutes later, the doctor arrived.  he said \"what do we have here, an ingrown hair?  let's have a look.\"  i felt relieved.  \"it's not that bad,\" i told myself, \"he'll just tell me the antibiotics should take care of it, maybe at the worst, poke it with a needle.\"  the doc took a look.  \"you've got a cyst,\" he said to me.  \"get me a number 11 scalpel.\" he said to the nurse.\n\nthen he said some other things, but i don't know what they were because i all could hear was the word \"scalpel...scalpel...scalpel\" going through my head.  i asked him to repeat everything after \"scalpel.\"  he informed me that the cyst was infected and would need to be drained.  he would need to make a small incision.\n\nnow, at this point, quasimodo began to get very nervous.  seinfeld fans are doubtless familiar with the concept of \"shrinkage.\"  well, there was significant shrinkage at this point.  then the doctor said \"now, we could use a local anesthetic, but i'll be honest, it's going to hurt either way \u2013 the anesthetic will probably hurt longer than the actual incision will.\"\n\ni smiled confidently (at least i told myself it was a confident smile \u2013 i noticed my voice had gone up an octave, though), and said \"you're the doc, you know best.\"  i thought to myself, \"did i just agree to have my manhood sliced into without benefit of painkillers?\"  the doctor was saying something again, but i didn't really hear any of it.  \"shrinkage\" no longer seemed an adequate word.  quasimodo was now attempting to retreat completely from view, and my eyes were fixed upon the gleaming blade being carried by the nurse as she re-entered the room.\n\nnow, a number 11 scalpel is not very big.  i know this, from a rational point of view.  however, as it approached old quasimodo, it looked like it ought to be on the bottom of a lawn mower deck somewhere.  my brain dealt with this threat quickly and decisively.  it dumped my entire reserves of adrenaline into my bloodstream, and sent a series of urgent survival commands to my body.  these commands were as follows:  \"ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun, you fool!\"\n\nalas, i could not run.  the nurse had regained her grip on quasimodo, and i was bared to the blade.  i reflected with a sense of poignant longing on my awakening earlier that day, when the worst problem i had was exhaustion and a terrible cough.  it was a happier, more innocent time when the idea of a knife-wielding maniac going after my privates was not even on my radar.\n\nthe doctor said \"this is going to hurt, but you can stand it for two seconds.  that's all i will need, just two seconds. try not to move.\"  i should mention at this point, that i had regained a shaky sense of calm by telling myself \"he's just going to make a quick cut across the surface of the skin.  just a scratch, really.\"  i was just finishing telling myself that, when he drove the point of the scalpel directly down into the cyst!  i had been skewered!  helpfully, he began counting the two seconds for me.  i remember distinctly\u2014he said\n\n\"oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee....... thoooooooouuuuuuuuussssssaaaaaaaanddddddddd oooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\u2026\u2026ooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeee thooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuussssssaaaaaaaannnnnnddddddddddd twoooooooooooooooooooooooo.... doooooooooooooooooooone.\"\n\nwhile the longest two seconds in my life were counted out, i was very busy.  one part of my brain was still shrieking \"ruuuuuuuun!\" while another part was yelling \"don't move, you fool!\" and the rest of it was just mumbling \"knife in my penis! knife in my penis! knife in my penis!\" over and over.  the \"don't move\" portion of my brain won out, because when a man with a knife at your junk tells you not to move, you bloody well don't move!  the blade went a lot deeper than i had expected it to, and then the doctor sliced down \u2013 just a fraction of an inch\u2014and wiggled the blade just a tiny bit. \n\nto put it succinctly, it was a sensation not unlike pain.  \n\ni will spare you a description of the aftermath, as it was gory and disgusting and not at all funny.  when it was over, the doc informed me i should come back on friday, since if the cyst didn't drain out completely, we'd have to do a local anesthetic and \"cut it out and stitch it up.\"  i gather that this will be a more involved, and presumably more painful process, since we tried to avoid it the first time.  i can hardly wait for friday.\n\nfinal note:  apparently these cysts \"just happen.\" \u2013 mine had probably been lurking in an uninfected form for a while, and only got noticed once infection started.  they aren't dangerous, but once infected they need to get dealt with.  the doctor and staff at the urgent care were great, and the procedure really was less painful than i thought it would be \u2013 but then, i do have a very vivid imagination.  i'd try to score macho points for having it done without anesthetic, but quasimodo is living in fear of friday and totally ruining my machismo.\nSummary: 1) a doctor would have known best.2) an incisioon would not have hurt like that.3) the situation would never have",

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: i didnt fuck up today, this is about a years worth of fuckups leading to the ultimate fuckup, losing the one you love.\n\nso to start off with some context, about 2 years ago i met this girl on steam. now it was a completely random meeting she ended up adding me off some guy's friend list. this was some guy i had met before and we weren't really close he was just an ok fellow to play with.\nso this girl (ill call her rachel or r from now on) added me and asked me about a game series out of the blue. it was a funny way to start a conversation but we did have a good conversation about it, went on for hours. \n\ni was hoping because i didnt have many good friends at the time that she would sprout into one of those. now keep in mind, i have no idea the extent of what shes been through or that anything is going wrong for her at this time.\n\nso the next couple days all she does is send me invites for a game which i thought was an odd way to be a friend no conversation. so i ignored them for a while hoping that maybe she would talk to me further at some point, but i wasnt hopeful for much. actually i had planned on removing her like a week or two after we met because it wasnt promising. \n\nafter much of these invites, i decide to finally join up on one. im in the game and of course its her friends in the game and they sorta gang up on me because i suck but whatever i ride it out because maybe joining this will get her to talk to me. \n\nits now been roughly a month and ive joined a few of her games but still we haven't talked much other than one line responses primarily me joking about her invites. \n\na little bit further down the line from that, she brings something semi-serious up (im sorry its been a long time i cant really remember) that strikes my interest. so naturally trying to be good, i talk to her about it and offer my experience in wanting to be different as well. (i was a trolling asshole at this point and i wanted real friends basically) \nthis conversation happened and we became a little bit closer, eventually getting to the point of actually talking about school, games, etc. basic things. \n\nwe then progressed further often playing games and whatnot talking on skype having a good time. this is going well and i think ive found myself a good new friend. \n\none night im playing a game with my friend and its like 2am my time so im a bit tired and getting ready to sleep soon. all of a sudden i was having a conversation with r about things in her past she had an ex that apparently things did not go well at all with. we're talking in text chat while i play with my friend and she seems very upset about the whole situation rightfully so. \n\ni try to comfort her, tell her that shes not wrong for thinking this way in a summed up sense, that things did suck and listened to her full story. the guy she was talking about is crucial to this, so ill call him k or kraig. at this point, k seems like the worst person ever to me because he treated her like garbage, refused to respond to her, and ignored her cries for help. getting into that: this is pretty much when she opened up to me a bit about issues shes struggled with, depression, relationship issues, warped definitions of affection, many \nthings she should not have had to struggle with.\n\nso now i know all this and it begins to make sense to me why she just sent me invites and didnt talk to me, she has overwhelming anxiety and other things that are horrible to deal with. i ended up talking to her on skype and telling my friend brb in voice while i went to talk to her. she was crying and she seemed the most upset shes ever let me hear her, and i felt horrible. \n\nthe toll that what shes been through had taken on her crushed me it sucked to see someone feel that low. so this night has happened and she seemed a lot better at the end of it and she thanked me for talking to her i got her to cheer up i know that. this event has brought us closer and now we talk a lot more about personal things like what shes dealt with and more serious things. \n\nwe've become really close as friends and she brings up this k guy semi-often and i sorta just told her forget about him he sucks because he did in my mind. \n\nnow this is whats crazy is not to get into details but i had something happen to me that seemed like a slight pain that wasnt a big deal to me so i mostly ignored it. however, she convinced me to do something about it and go to the emergency room and i know it sounds stupid but i really wasnt going to do it before she insisted i do. turns out, that could've killed me if i had let it go so in a way she saved my life. \n\nroughly a month in the hospital and im out, and shes there still being a great friend to me.\n\nby this point i really like her shes become a very important person to me, and ive got a little crush on her.\nthings go on we're still having fun enjoying time together when my first major screwup happens. there was a night we were talking and stupidly i bugged her to put k in the skype call. \n\nwhy did i do this, well because k really bothered me i hated him for what he did to her and all i wanted to do was cuss him out and insult him, things of that nature. now from her point it looks like i just wanted to start drama between them and watch, which wouldve been a poor move on my part. i fought for my side and she wasnt having it so i ended up making her remove me because i was being pushy about it. \nso a few months go by and i decided to add her back to fix this situation because i really loved being around her she was amazing. a few months after this happened there was this guy she liked and was gonna tell him her feelings. i convinced her go for it do it, i hope things work out for you. \n\nthe guy ended up rejecting her not wanting that relationship with her and she was kinda bummed but i told her to keep her head up. about 10 minutes later i dropped a serious bomb on her and asked her out, she was stunned and told me she'd love to be my girlfriend but she needed time to think things over about k and prior things. \n\nso i gave her the time, a few days later she agreed to it. things are going good with r i love her and she says she loves me we're doing it all well. about 4 or 5 months in, second screwup happens where its revealed that i lied about something since we started dating. \ncompletely wrong on my part, i screwed up bad there and i felt terrible for it but the circumstances made it hard to come clean. we make up from that, things are decent again and its going smooth.\n\nshe tells me she wants to really deal with k again which is fine because i feel shes loyal to me and she needs to do what she needs to do.\nabout a month or two later, im feeling very distant to her and it seems like she doesnt want to do as much with me. maybe im being overly attached but she seems different, shes obviously upset about something i know her. i asked her a few times albeit lightly if she had anything wrong, if she was doing ok to which she replied yes all was well. but i knew this wasnt the same girl i had been with, things had changed. \n\ni asked her again whats the deal, is something changed whats wrong. this time she told me what the issue was straight up. this is speedbump #3 (keep in mind im sorta thinking that maybe screwup #2 was what did this to us) where she says she never had a crush on me when i asked her out and she didnt feel that way about me. so that kinda sucked... and she said the reason she'd been so distant was because shes been trying to deal with k. \n\ni tell her i get it and she says she grew feelings for me being in that relationship and she wants to sit somewhere between dating and friendship. i tell her i understand and we do that. she talked to me a lot the next week or so about k and how she messed up with him and she wants to make things right. i supported her with this but i still think that k is terrible on the inside and he wronged r. \n\na couple days pass and screwup #4 happens which is where i decide on my own will (she pretty much was saying dont do this) to add k and see if he had gotten some very important messages r sent him. now, r's main problem with k and why shes so hurt is because k never listened to her and she finally thinks that k did listen to her messages.\ni dont think he did and as such adding him i ask if he ever got them. i had done this because i was sick of k wasting r's time with this and i felt in my own mind it was best to have r move on. he says no and i tell r, where did i fuck up, well she didnt want to know that and i should have asked her if she wanted to... what an idiot i was to take that away from her.\n\n keep in mind shes always felt like people didnt care or listen to her for years up until recently so that was crucial for her. again, completely fucked up on my part and i wish i had never done that why do i keep fucking up with this girl? she tell me she doesnt forgive me and a few days later she ends up forgiving me but telling me what i did was wrong. \n\ni understand, but on the night she told me she forgave me... you guessed it, fuckup #5. i messaged her a thing about how i still care about her and she means a lot to me and im so glad she forgave me glad to have her as a friend. and i meant all that it made me happy to send, now heres where i went wrong. after sending that i didnt really get a response to it which i shouldve known meant \"back off man i dont feel this way at the moment\" but i didnt because im an idiot.\n so naturally i sent her something a day later asking if the message meant anything to her and would i be able to earn back the trust i had destroyed. this was basically me being selfish and going do you still like me after i had screwed up not but a few days prior. she responds upset to it saying that i need to chill out and shes upset with me for being pushy so i just drop it. \n\na day and a half (the half leading up to now) passes where she doesnt talk to me. shes messaged me today a little bit saying that again i need to chill out which is perfectly understandable. so thats what i plan to do, i dont think she really believes that im going to though based on her response. i think at this point, if it wasnt already, our relationship is over that has no chance of returning. but as of now, im kinda worried whether we'll even have that close friendship we used to have.\n\nyou might be asking yourself, why is this ironic what you've done? well, a lot of the times when i talked to her about serious things and attempted to cheer her up, it was involving guys that had done similar things to me. the very things i vowed id never do if i got to be with a girl like her. one of them, the pushy thing where i tried to get over something too fast was what a guy (we'll say s) did to her plenty and shes annoyed about it still because it happened a lot. shes also been lied to a lot and she said one thing she never wanted was someone who lied (similar to another ex) which is exactly what i did. but also since before i ever met her, id always wanted a girl that i could treat right because everyone always thinks they can be that good guy and do things right. i really thought i could and it was my philosophy that i would never mistreat a girl if i got one, look what happened. i hurt her probably as much if not more than her ex's have. what kind of a monster does that make me? i dont know whats gonna happen from here, but i do know that its all my fault for how this has gone. \n\nwhile im on the topic though, id like to get some frustration out. mainly that inner me wishes k never existed because of all hes done to her and i would have never been this over pushy asshole if this situation hadnt arisen and made my confidence die. its a shitty excuse and it doesnt make it right, but i felt like saying that. i probably dont deserve her anyway at this point for all ive done to her, i can agree with that. but i just wish i could've had this and done right to her instead of treating her like the very scum i warned her never to be with. \n\nid like to know what people on here think, yes even if its completely negative because i did screw up big time here it was my fault all of this. sorry to her, sorry to everyone whos facepalming at what a jackass ive been and how little i deserve to be happy with her. i agree completely, many bonehead moves on my part i should have never even thought about.\nSummary:  i fucked my chances with the girl of my dreams and ill never get to hold her hand or even say i like you again. <br>\nQuestion",

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: hi reddit. so tifu, well actually i am currently in the middle of this fu. this is a story of panic and fear - both of which are emotions i'm dealing with right now. i'm hoping writing it down will make me feel better, whilst also keeping me busy until i get some resolution.\n\n\nyesterday, at 11.55pm it was the hand in for my final university assignment. a 12,000 word dissertation that of course i'd left to the last minute (truth: i'm an adrenaline procrastinator). i'd spent all the last week working on this baby in the vain hope of getting a pass and yesterday, at 11pm i'd finally hit word count. 101 references were in. contents page done, front cover, acknowledgements... all done. at around about 11.20pm i go to hand in. commence fu.\n\nnow, the system our university uses is called moodle and the hand in is done through an upload process called turnitin. i've been using this system for 4 years, never had any real problems with it. you log in to moodle, select the module you want to submit for, select assignment>submit>upload>submit through turnitin, then (depending on how busy the sytem is) you get an email receipt. easy, right? \n\nso, i get to the submit page and everything looks different. it's been changed. i don't get it, i start panicking. my tired bloodshot eyes scour the page, grasping for something they recognise... but wait! upload icon! that's got to be it! oh alcoholly1985, you're such a drama queen! i select the file 'complete dissertation', press upload, confirmation of upload pops up and boom. done.\n\nnow, just a quick aside: i need to come clean about something reddit, because i'm not telling you the whole truth. the truth would include the fact that due to it being my last ever piece of coursework and i had gotten to the point where i was just desperate to get *anything* in... i'd had a glass of celebratory wine... before i'd actually submitted it. this wine was partying away in my stomach by itself, because i'd been working so hard i hadn't actually eaten. \n\nso, to recap: i'd uploaded the file on this strange new set up, whilst slightly pissed. i continued to celebrate with my mother and had a couple more glasses (and a shower, i had been in work mode for 5 days straight without a shower. i smelt like 3 day dead tramp in a compost heap). of course, i decided that i should double check that i'd submitted the right file before the actual deadline passed. so log in, go through the same process, there's my dissertation file sitting in the uploads, imprinted with my hopes and dreams... but there's some red writing above it: **draft not submitted**.\n\nnow, the way turnitin works is that it automatically checks for plagiarism by scanning your work and searching the internet, online journal databases, your friends work, your own past work and lots of other stuff. this then gives you a % of likeness to other work, so you can see if maybe you missed out an in cite reference, or been caught out for being a rotten cheater. at undergraduate level, we were bullied into referencing right from the beginning, so were given only one turnitin link for each assignment. however, at postgrad level there are a lot of students that join from other institutions and countries who may not have used references at all, so a 'draft submission' link was added to allow you to see whether you've got to change something. i never use this link, i'm confident that all my work is my own and i'm pretty hot on the in cite referencing front. so when i saw the **draft not submitted** all red and angry, i thought 'oh yeah, well i didn't submit a draft, that's fine' and toddled (truth: staggered) off to bed to sleep (truth: collapse across my bed in a wine-induced coma).\n\nthis morning, day after deadline, i wake up with relief and that gnawing worry you feel after submitting any coursework that's worth 33% of your final grade. i pick up my phone and see that i still haven't received my receipt of submission. i'm only a little worried as receipts often take longer than they're supposed to, especially if you hand in close to deadline time (truth: i'm a repeat offender, closest i've been is 4 minutes before). i decide to check again on moodle just to make sure it is in fact just a glitch in the system. i log in, go through to my submission and grades and there, in damning, accusatory letters are the words :**no submission. grade: 0.00% (dropped)**. i panic. i'm shaking, my heart is racing and i'm starting to cry. but hold on - i uploaded it! i race over to the link on my phone and i can see that the upload is still there. i take a screenshot (so i can prove i uploaded *something*) and get straight onto facebook to message my supervisor. i explain that the submission process was different, that i **had** uploaded my work but it hadn't gone through... it was around then that i realised the **draft not submitted** was not in fact instructing me that i hadn't submitted a draft, it was telling me that my upload *was* a draft and had not been submitted. i know, i'm an idiot. complete and utter fool.\n\nmy supervisor gets straight back to me and explains she's on annual leave, but she'll email the course director and see what it says on the system. i apologise and say i'll email him. so i just have. and now here i am waiting to see if i've failed the largest and most important piece of work i've ever done. brilliant.\n\n \n\n**edit**: as my mind is a complete mess right now, it's been brought to my attention that i didn't explain why i'd have to redo the report. at my uni, if you submit work and it fails (which includes late submissions), you're not allowed to resubmit the same work. now, i'm not sure where i stand atm (cause of the whole draft issue). if my uploaded file isn't counted, then i can submit a blank word document which will become the file that relates to the 0% grade. i'd then be given another chance to hand in with a cap at 40%, which would be my actual report. if this document is counted as a late submission, then i'd have to redo the whole thing with a new research question. either way it's looking a bit shit.\n\n**update**: for people that were wondering, i finally heard back! so apparently i **did not** submit my work properly! the course director replied telling me that i was right, moodle had changed slightly, and to enter my final submission i had to scroll all the way down and *select the 'final submission' button'*. seriously, i'm so bloody stupid. this would process the submission through turnitin (truth: i'm a complete idiot). i replied asking if i would be penalised for a late submission, he replied:\n\n\n\"there is no penalty for a late submission... it is an automatic 0%...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...but i can see you tried to upload before the deadline so it's fine.\" (and yes, he did it so i'd have to scroll down the email!).\n\nso all's fine!

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: *not today - about a year ago.*\n\ni was hiking in the red rocks of sedona, arizona with my friend matthew. the breeze was blowing gracefully and the sky solid blue. a little warm, but in arizona standards 'a little warm' is a fucking treat. anyway, for those that don't know, sedona is a haven for beautiful, bright red rock formations that vary in size and verticality (a.k.a. mountains). hiking is a pastime for locals so i tried to play my part. matthew and i met at cathedral rock, a hike as treacherous as it was majestic. now i was in no way an experienced hiker, or athletic in any sense, but i was confident that my previous 2.5 hikes qualified me to act as such. without hesitation i began my voyage up the elaborate hill, stomping intently through the red dirt and doing my best to make 4-foot step ups look like a joke. i climbed wittingly, like a mountain goat bringing food up to its babies. i was dexterous and skilled in my climbing. a luminescent hiking guru if you will. my posture was proud and my pace was that of someone who could not fail. matthew, unimpressed by my aggression, kept up. \n\nfast forward 90 minutes. we neared the top quicker than expected. after all, taking breaks and enjoying scenery was nonessential. our speed had dropped significantly. looking down the 60 degree angle mountainside, my resentful aches and shortness of breath turned into adoration. it was beautiful. our starting point was out of sight and about 2 miles away in distance and height. the treeline swirled elegantly around the perimeter of the creek. the other rock formations were casting massive shadows on the town below. the entirety of sedona seemed like a small village tucked away in a biblical cubbyhole. it was a great value grand canyon of sorts. \n\nafter matthew and i finished mirin' the views, it was time for part 2: the descent. now most people i'm sure would go down the way they came up. but that wasn't good enough for ol' matthew and i. we needed to see the other side of cathedral rock. the \u2018real\u2019 side. \u2018real\u2019 meaning not the way that we came up which had trail signs and an occasional path\u2026 disgusting. what are we, tourists? we scoped things out and planned our downward route. sweaty and sore, we were only at the halfway point, but what goes up must come down. the next 20 minutes were cake. we slid and hopped our way down with style and grace. my sore quads and calfs were stiffening. my feet were aching from repeated 4+ foot landings on rock but i was doing just fine. we joked about if we would die falling from certain points and even taunted each other by pretending to trip near edges. \n\nthe steep sliding slopes gradually became steeper. the tall drop offs became a little taller. our exhausted playfulness turned suddenly into concern. we shared a moment of realization. we were in a bad spot. we looked down at a series of downslopes and cliffs that had \u2018127 hours\u2019 written all over them. we began to reevaluate our actions thus far. we decided we wouldn\u2019t make it so the new idea was to just go back up to the top, take the lame ass tourist path back down, and be home in time for dinner. but it quickly became clear that the slopes we slid down were too steep to climb back up. we were stuck. we had no phone service, no water and no idea what the hell we were doing.. \n\nafter contemplating our doom for a few minutes we came to a mutual decision. we had to try to slide down. it was the only way. i don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever had one way out of a situation and that one way out being to throw yourself down a mountainside, but it\u2019s not a great feeling. dread and fear took over. there were three downlopes in a row, about 10 feet each. there were flat ledges (varying 2-6 feet) in between them. there was no line of sight after the third ledge. the objective was to slowly and methodically slide down each slope in order to be able stop at each ledge and repeat the process until we were in the clear. high on adrenaline, i went first. i stood at the first slope, trying to not show fear in my body language. i carefully got down on my butt, pressed my feet firmly on the dusty red rock, put my hands down behind me for extra friction, and began to scale down. i slid a little too fast for comfort but i was able to stick my landing at the bottom. i took a breathe but didn\u2019t give myself time to realize how fucking scared i was. i put my butt, feet and hands down. i slid down the second slope. this one was slightly less steep and it was easy to control my slide and make it to the bottom. now this third ledge was different. it was a little longer and a little steeper and the ledge at the bottom was a little shorter. and even though i had come this far i still couldn\u2019t see past it. i don\u2019t know if optimistic is the appropriate word but it\u2019s the best way i can explain my mindset at the time. maybe optimism was my only choice. \n\nthe time had come. fate had lead me here. the final slope was before me and there was no opportunity to coward out. at this point i was suppressing my thoughts because there were no good thoughts to be had. \u201cwell, here we go.\u201d i said to myself, and in a moment that felt like sheer heroism, as carefully as i could, i began to slide down. the first few feet of the slope were behind me a little too quickly and it was at this point i realized i was going to pass that cliff whether i liked it or not. time slowed down. those next four seconds took up more than half of my 22 year life as far as i\u2019m concerned. i could feel the rock seperate from my feet and ass as i lost control. my stomach ceased to exist and i was taken over by that feeling you get when you\u2019ve leaned too far back in a chair. my body was desperate to find a way to stop itself but nothing could be done. my momentum had accumulated way too much by the time i reached the bottom. in a last attempt effort to stop, i thrusted my feet down on the ledge at the bottom of the slope. this sprung my body upwards into a standing position, and lift-off was commenced. i muttered out \u201cawhsh\u201d because i was too preoccupied to pronounce \u201coh, shit\u201d.  i looked down and felt the sensation of being in a dream where you\u2019re falling from the sky. i straightened my body like i was jackknifing into a pool because my instinct told me to. i felt weightless and remember thinking \u201cam i really still falling?\u201d. finally, me and the ground became one. i slammed foot first into the unforgiving earth and with my hard earned velocity kept rolling. my torso and head followed instantly. i was worried that i might roll off of another cliff if i didn\u2019t stop. i ragdolled into a cactus and for the first time in what felt like a long time, my body was still. convinced that i had just crossed over i quickly sat up to see what the afterlife was like. it was then that reality set it, along with the pain. \n\ni remember looking behind me, seeing the 20 foot cliff i had just fallen off of and thinking, \u201cthis is a good story.\u201d i heard matthew yell my name, but in a way that he wasn\u2019t sure i would respond. \u201cdanny?!\u201d his voice echoed. \u201cyea..\u201d i yelled as though i was inconvenienced by his call. i tried to stand and immediately fell back down. my foot was done for. i sat there and cursed to myself while i waited for matthew to scale conveniently around the hellscape. in that time i recorded a video documenting my injuries. i ended it with: \u201ci don\u2019t have much to give away but you can talk amongst yourselves.\u201d \n\nmatthew eventually got to me. the next five or six hours was spent trudging down the mountain one legged and crawling. matt had to supervise my every move to inch me through the terrain, and getting past three foot areas took planning and vigilance. i crawled through thorn bushes, mud puddles, gravel and cactus. i was covered in sweat and blood. my clothes were torn and my foot was dangling impotently from my leg. the rest of the descent is a story of its own, but to make a long story medium: we finally reached the bottom of the mountain. the feeling of being ground level was the single most gratifying/relieving thing i have ever felt. we came to the creek and splashed water on our faces and drank. we trekked the remaining mile, me hopping on one leg using a stick as a makeshift crutch, and then him carrying me on his back. at last we made glorious arrival to the car. before retiring my stick and getting in, i glanced back to catch the sun falling behind the unforgiving formation in which i had almost died on. my pain and spiritual exhaustion made way for a quick smile of admiration. \n\n\nto my dear friend matthew, thanks for literally walking through the valley of the shadow of death with me. if you weren't there i still would be.\n\n\nmoral of the story: don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew, because life will make you chew.\nSummary:  I was climbing a rock when I fell off and injured myself. I had a lot of pain but I made it through and was safe inthe end",

miriam is somewhat more so than the rest of us. she's really cool and a great friend if you remain on her good side (which is not difficult if you're a decent human being), so all her joking about the dozens of painful and terrifying ways she could kill you is totally fine. i might fear for my life if i ever pissed her off, but fortunately, she makes it clear when you're starting to upset her so i've never seen anything escalate far enough to prompt her to any action. sarah is just a bit weird, but likewise cool if you're friends with her. i've been friends with both all four years of high school now.\n\nanyway, two years ago (my sophomore year), the morning of my fuck up, we're sitting in the commons, as is the custom before school. i'm talking to miriam and sarah, and somehow the topic of duct taping me to the ceiling comes up. it's a totally normal conversation, and still nothing unusual when miriam jokes about slitting my throat and letting me bleed all over the other students, sort of like spider-man, except i couldn't ninja my way out of a window before any of them saw me. whatever, completely hypothetical, no way that would actually happen (school ceilings don't support student weight (duh)). sarah then says they should use craft scissors to make it more bloody and gory, and effectively be ripping my throat out. we go on like that for a bit, and while it was not unlike other similarly weird and morbid conversations before, it stuck with me as particularly funny.\n\ni get to my math class later that day, and my teacher is in there, whom we'll call ms. puritan, is just that. it's her first year teaching, and she is such a stickler for rules and protocol that puritan is the only description that does her justice. i have a number of good friends in that class, and so near the end of the period, i decide to recount the epic tale of planning my weird marvel-inspired vertically-peculiar demise. apparently, ms. puritan thinks i'm confiding in my friends that i've been threatened or something, but says nothing to me; i walk out of that class and onto the next just like any other teenager that day. it isn't until the next day that my error hits me.\n\nit just so happens that instead of talking to me, ms. puritan decided to go right ahead and email the principal, who in turn emails my grade's guidance counselor, and they decide they need to sit down and chat with me. get to school the next day, and in the middle of one of my classes, i get called down to the office. now, i'm confused. i'm caught up in all my classes (that's the most common reason i end up down there) and i've gotten no other discipline referrals. i walk in and bam, there's ms. puritan, sitting with the principal (mr. coolio) and my grade's guidance officer (mr. chillguy). both those guys are totally cool and chill, as their changed names would suggest. but hey, they've got jobs to do, so mr. coolio says (something along the lines of) \"ms. puritan brought to our attention that you were threatened by some classmates. is that true?\" i say that to the best of my knowledge, no, because i still had no idea why the hell i got called to his office. he tells me that ms. puritan heard me having a \"school-inappropriate conversation\" that involved me saying some other students were planning on killing me. i don't remember for sure if she had remembered and shared the details, or just the killing me part, but that was enough to remind me of what they were talking about. i explained the first conversation that was had before school the previous day, and how miriam and sarah were trusted friends, then how i was simply retelling the story to some friends in ms. puritan's class because i had thought it was funny. they have a brief regrouping, and then mr. chillguy asks me if i feel safe around the two friends and if i feel threatened by them at all. my first answer was apparently not clear enough, so i tell them again: yes, i feel safe around them, and no, i do not feel threatened even in the slightest. come on, if miriam wanted to hurt me, she would. she only jokes about hurting people if she plans on actually hurting them. she'd jump right past the joking and just hurt them. they continue this interrogation for around ten minutes, then are finally convinced my life isn't in any danger, but still seem a little wary, ms. puritan especially (spoiler: miriam hasn't killed me yet). i had a couple appointments with mr. chillguy in the weeks after to make sure i was still fine, and now it's become an off-handed inside joke between us.\n\nfor the most part, that's the end of that, and it makes a great story to share with other people. i'm sure ms. puritan was super worried about me for the rest of the year, though, because later on, i got it in the head with a text book. well, a friend lightly whapped me with it, but the teacher still decided she needed to, again, not talk to me, but call the nurse and tell them i probably had a concussion. and so i got called down to the nurse's office and given a complete concussion evaluation, while having no clue why. only after did they tell me it was because ms. puritan told them. i said they could have just asked me and i'd have told them i was fine, but they still insisted that they needed to be sure.\nSummary: icymi, (in case you missed it) the summary was written in response to a question in a reddit post which asked for an example of how",

dior. i'm a guy without a fashion sense so bonus negative points for not knowing what the hell i'm walking into. i walk right up to an employee (an older man wearing a sharp suit) who appears to be the only one in the store, and i ask to try on some pants. he looks at me for 10 seconds, and he says hold on let me get the manager/owner (i can't remember) and she might be able to assist. he calls for her and she comes out of these glass doors like a princess and eyes me for about 10 seconds as well. she looks at the man and back to me. \n\n\"what is it i can help you with?\" \n\n\"i'd like to try on some pants.\" \n\n\"i don't think we have anything for you.\" \n\n\"i'd like to try anyways just to see.\"\n\n\"i will assist though i do know how to do my job.\"\n\n\"i'm sure you do.\" - i said this as nervous and oblivious to the situation as possible. she was the most intimidating person i've ever encountered in a store before.\n\nshe comes back with a pair of pants and says, \"this is a size 54 in italian, the biggest we have.\" i don't know how to respond, but i take the pants and enter their 50,000 dollar glass dressing room. i continue to try on the pants, and this is when i realize what i have done. i put one leg into the pair, and i see the price tag at the same time i realize my leg doesn't fit. 700 dollars. this was the moment i admitted defeat. i step out, and the lady just wasn't amused. i couldn't have possibly felt more stupid. the look on her face man...\n\nthe man was really nice though, and he asked what the rush was. i explain my situation and he offers to try a macy's right outside the hotel. it was weird though because he asked permission from the lady if he could give me this advice. he probably feared her as well... i thank him and i head back to where the club was to look at my options. \n\nfirst i realized there was no macy's just outside the hotel. maybe he was mistaken, or maybe he saw how pathetic the situation was and just tried to be optimistic. after that scenario all i really had left was the damn ticket. this is where i needed someone to say, \" no fn_strobe, don't you fucking dare. don't do it you miserable bastard!\" you probably guessed it, i decided to see if i could sell the ticket. in the encore. surrounded by people with some serious cash.\n\nin front of the club was a group of about 12 guys. one of them was arguing to the same bouncer about the same fucking thing as the other guy. it was probably the same guy just with a mob of his friends. i don't know why i thought it was a good idea, but i tried to get his attention. tickets were 80 bucks at the door, and i said, \"i'll give you one for 40.\" i know, it's pathetic. these guys probably never had an issue with money in their whole lives, so it's a good chance they were just drunk and giving the bouncer a hard time.\n\nthree of the guys turn to me and laugh. one looked back at his friend and said, \"hey look at this kid trying to offer you a ticket.\" the main guy turned and said, \" tell that kid to fuck off!\". two turned to me and basically said to get the fuck out of there. i walked away feeling worse than before...\n\nit was so dumb. dumb, dumb, dumb. i felt like a roach. it was an insane feeling, but it was all my fault so all i could do was blame myself. \n\ni fucking cried man. i wanted to just throw the ticket away, but at the last moment i saw these two guys talking about how to get tickets for the show the next day. they stood out because of how happy they seemed. they were foreigners with bad english, and they wanted to see major lazer who were dj'ing the night after. i walk up to one and asked if they wanted to see the set playing tonight. all they kept saying was, \"major lazer?\" and i said, \"no this is for skrillex tonight.\" they said ok and asked how much, but i just couldn't. with my luck i was afraid the ticket probably wouldn't work after all, so i just told them to take it and have fun. that was the longest walk ever back to the monte carlo.\n\nthe whole way back all i could think of was going back to that dior shop with some serious cash, buying a bunch of shit and setting it all on fire in front of that woman while making it rain with hundred dollar bills over it. to top of the night, i hit a slot machine and lost the 60 i did have. vegas man...\nSummary:  to sum up, we had to spend a lot of money on a club in vegas, because we did not dress appropriately for a night club, in",

(let it be know that these actions are very typical of my brother when he is high. i knew it had started kicking in at this point.) i smiled and asked him what was wrong.\n\n\"i don't know if i can watch this anymore. that is a man with a life of pain!\"\nhe continued to keep the show paused.\n\n\"i think he just expresses his pain through music very well. i don't think he is living in a life a pain.\" i knew my brother was really starting to feel the cookie at this point, but i started to fear that his vibrations were becoming negative.\n\n\"yea...\" he stood up and walked to the bathroom. at this point i am watching the daily show. radiohead was not working for him. after about ten minutes i heard him walking around. now i knew something was wrong. he walked right by me and walked out the back door. \n\ni waited for him to come back in. before i can even get a word out...\n\n\"that guy put something more than weed in those cookies!\"\n\nhe doesn't\n\n\"no, he doesn't. i know a lot of people who eat them. i eat them. you are ok. trust me.\"\n\nhe come across the living room and sits down on the couch.\n\"but...\"\n\nthe pause was longer than i expected. now my brother was was pouring sweat, eyes half shut and mouth half open. i could almost see the thoughts that were running through his mind.\n\n\"but... i am gonna die.\"\n\noh no. this isn't good. i always looked up to my brother and went to him for advice. now in the deepest, darkest pits of his despair i can't think of anything to say to him to bring him out of this. i have no clue what to say.\n\n\"bro... you are ok. i promise. look at me. i am alright right now. i ate more than you. relax. it is just a different high than smoking. you didn't smoke anything but you are still high. it's hard to believe, i know, but you are ok. sit back relax and put yourself in a better place.\"\n\nmy words took no hold in his head. i could just see the pain and anguish and the tears starting to stream down his cheeks along with the sweat.\n\n\"duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuddde! i am gonna die! i don't want to die!\"\nhe stands up and throws his hands in the air and storms out of the house. now me being high i am starting to lose my mind a little. his negative waves of energy started flowing all around, everywhere! the dog was getting anxious and pacing back and forth. i'm on the edge of my seat wondering what to do, just thinking that he is bugging out and has to driv.... oh god! i don't have a ride home now. what can i do? i am stuck in the middle of nowhere without even a gas station around for nine miles and i am stuck here with him going nuts! and i am going nuts now too!\n\nhe bursts back in with a look of bewilderment on his face, shaking his head side to side and saying, \"i am going to die!\" my words had no effect on him. i was overwhelmed at this point. i pull out my phone and message my dad. i asked him to pick me up asap and i will explain later.\ni sat on the couch watching this insanity that continued to ensue. the pacing back and forth. the sweating. the constant outbursts of \"i don't want to die!\" i started to feel like i would try again to calm him down.\n\n\"relax man. yes. you are going to die one day, but not tonight. not right now. you have things to do before you die. places to go and people to meet. we all die and that's ok. just focus on the \"right now\" of everything. don't worry about death. death isn't right now.\"\n\nmy brother disagreed. death was right now for him. nothing was getting that out of his head. for all he knew... he was already dead.\n\n\"but... but..\"\nhe stood up and walked down the hall, still saying \"but.\" i could hear him pacing. i heard him stop, turn around and started walking back towards me.\n\n\"but david! how will i call anyboooooooaaaaaaagggghhhhh!\"\n\nthe sound of my brother releasing that nights chili dinner all over the floor was full of anger. it was loud with the sound of someone screaming \"whhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat\" at the tops of their lungs. i sat there stunned and shouted \"larry!\" \nhe looked up at me shocked and bewildered shaking his head with his hands in the air, giving the appearance of someone who is way too confused. he walked to the back door and again.\n\n\"whhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat\"\n\nall over the rug for the back door. he stands up again and says to himself, \"i can't believe this.\" throws his hands in the air \"i'm going to die,\" and walks out side. i just hear him pacing back and forth, emitting the worst dry heaving sounds known to man.\n\nby this time i has been two hours since i had text my father. i walk downstairs to get my shoes. i hear my brother back in the house dry heaving over the toilet. \n\n\"dude are you going to be ok?\"\n\ni hear a faint, \"i sure hope so.\"\ni use this opportunity to leave the house and get into the car with my father who had just pulled up. my dad was not happy and asked what had happened. \n\"did you ever have a friend who just smoked way too much and they probably just needed some alone time?\"\n\ni woke up this morning to some text messages from my brother saying he was way too high last night and he was sorry if he had scared me.

july, and one of my buddies and i saw smoke bombs at a fireworks stand last night and reminisced, i figured i would post it here for you. \n\n my parents had a small business which they had just shut down. i was 17, and i got two of my friends to come help with me with breaking a lot of stuff down, loading up boxes into my parents vehicle and my own, etc. we had my 94 dodge intrepid loaded down. i was driving, my friend \"corey\" was in the passenger seat, and my small statured friend \"wes\" was in the back seat, in the middle surrounded by boxes on all sides. \n\nit was a rainy night. we stopped at a gas station to get gas, and i pumped my fuel and went in to pay (this was before prepay was prevalent in alabama). i thanked the clerk and went back out to the car. now this particular gas station had pumps on one side, facing the highway, and pumps on the back side that you could not see from the front or from the road. this important.\n\nas i get back in the car and we start to drive away, myself and wes, for reasons i'll never understand considering we were not drunk, remember the two full boxes of smoke bombs we bought earlier that day. the little cherry looking kind. the gas station door was prop'd open, it had been raining and we figured it would be relatively safe, so we dare corey to light one and throw it at the door as we drive by. and he did. it was a green one if i remember correctly. \n\nwe promptly sped away giggling and pulled out on to the highway. going through the usual \"oh man, that was great\" type phrases, we hadn't even gotten out of sight of the gas station before i had blue lights all up in my mirror. i started having flash backs of when i walked into the gas station and seeing a tall guy prop'd up against the wall talking to the clerk, in a long black rain jacket. it turns out that guy was a state trooper. he had no hat on. his car was parked on the back side of the gas station. his long black rain jacket covered his belt with his gun, etc. \n\ni never went from laughing to \"oh fuck oh fuck\" so fast in my life. i told my friends that the state trooper saw it all, and they ask why i didn't tell them a fucking state trooper was in the gas station, and all i could say was \"dude i am so sorry, i didn't know.\"  i pull over. \n\nthe very first thing the cop does is go straight to the passenger side door, open it, and yank my friend corey out and yell \"what the fuck is your major malfunction son!\" (no joke, looking back we crack up at this every time and if he is ever moody i will scream this at him). the cop starts lighting into him. i start worrying because corey had a pretty bad temper back then, and the way he was yanked from the car, i feared assaulting an officer was going to be on the list of charges and we were never getting out of this without jail. after he gets done yelling at my friend, he turns to me, speaking from the passenger side, and asks me why in the fuck i would let someone throw a smoke bomb from a vehicle at a gas station in general, due to you know.. gas being flammable, but most especially right after seeing a state trooper in there. i explain that it is my fault, i encouraged it, and how i didn't realize he was a state trooper due to his long rain jacket. \n\nabout this time, the cop notices the tin box my fossil watch came in, that i kept all my change in. i had just took the change to a coin star that day, so it was empty, except for small flakes of tobacco, which he though was weed at first. see, i kept my cigarettes in my pockets, and my parents didn't know i smoked, so i often put butts in the pocket too until i threw them away somewhere. small bits of tobacco would be in my pocket when i put my change in there. i finally convince him it's just tobacco, and kind of worry that i'm going to get in trouble for that too, since i'm only 17 and the legal age was 19. \n\nthe cop has ran his flashlight over the windows and definitely asked why i had so much shit in the car. he asks us our names and ages. i say \"michael, and i'm 17\". then \"corey, and i'm 16.\" then.. \"wesley, and i'm 15\". i swear to god the flash light cut to wes so fast, and the cop let out a quick \"what the fuck, where did you come from!\" wes was so neatly positioned between all these boxes the cop would have never even noticed him unless he really searched the car.  \n\nanyway. we all know we're dead, we're just waiting on the axe. the cop has us get out of the car, the two of us with id's give him our id's, and he starts asking for our parents names and telephone numbers. we give him the info he requests. in my heart i know this is it. at the very least, my very strict parents were going to ground me until i was 18 and possibly longer if i didn't move out, and but probably going to jail. \n\nthen the most amazing thing ever happened. the state trooper softened up a little bit, and turns to us and says \"you guys scared that poor woman half to death. she almost went to an early grave because you damn near gave her a heart attack.\". he then turns to me and holds up my license and says \"if you want this back, follow me back to the gas station and all three of you go in there and give that woman your most sincere apology.\" which you better believe we all three went right back to that gas station and with our heads hung in shame, thoroughly apologized to that sweet woman. i got my license back, and we left. our trouble with the law it seemed, was over, but i still dreaded facing my parents when they found out. amazingly, none of our parents were ever called. my other two buddies parents were told years after the fact, but i'm not sure i ever told my parents.\nSummary: 1.

 i'm sorry.\"  i saw her leave in tears as i was desperately trying to tell her to stop.\n\n\ni would spend monday and tuesday away from work and alone.  i could feel myself slowly closing up again and, in sadness, my hands reached towards alcohol.  i spent monday in a regretful drunken state until i fell asleep.  i woke up on tuesday realizing what happened and sat alone again.  \n\n\ni thought back to everything in my past for a long time as i read texts from kaylee.  it was a long message that sounded almost as conflicted as i was; she still loved me but she could not get over the fact i was so reserved.  she said, \"maybe in time i can open you up, but, i should stay away for now.\"  \n\n\nthe **third** fuck-up happened when she came by unannounced.  the house was an absolute mess.  beer cans, wine bottles, strewn furniture, everything that i had done in my drunken, regretful, and somber states.  she let herself through the door and saw me on the couch with the smell of alcohol in the air.  i saw her slowly go from surprise  and confusion all the way to sadness and disappointment all in the span of 4 seconds.  she left with tears on her face again. i was crying from self-disappointment because i had lost the only person i had ever cared about. \n\n\n \n\n**edit**:  i will update this post and keep you guys in the light on how it goes.  hopefully i can find my way back, but it's gonna be hard without her being there as the light.  i messed up that night because i was in a jumble.  i was fearful for many reasons that i now know are meaningless.\n\n*~40 minutes after post:* currently cleaning up the place.  trying to see if she can come by tonight to talk.\n\n*~1.5 hours after post:*  i realize that a lot of this stemmed from me making excuses and letting her walk away.  i guess that's where i fucked up; i plan on fixing that.  still working out the details if she can come later.\n\n*~3 hours after post:*  she's agreed to eat out with me.  i know it should have been a bit more personal and just a one-on-one, but i decided to just go with the flow.  i asked her if she would like to eat with me at the restaurant where we met.  wish me luck, reddit!  will be gone for a bit, but thanks everyone for the advice and comments.  i won't be able to answer back to some of them for a while.\n\n\n*~5 hours after post:*  to sum up what happened at the restaurant dinner with kaylee, it started off awkwardly.  it was silent, and the moment i went to say something, she did as well.  we both started saying \"i'm sorry about that night.\"  we had some laughs as we stuttered over each other, but i was just so happy that she would hear me out still.  she let me talk first, so i told her what was on my mind.  i explained to her that i had a difficult past and, at the time when we had last talked, i did not want to share the \"burden\" with her.  i then told her that i had realized i made a huge mistake, and that i should be sharing it with her.\n\nthen she said something i will never forget.  \"i will never be able to understand your past, only you can do that... but, i will always be here for you.  you can share anything with me when you're ready.  the day we met at the restaurant...  i don't know how lucky i was to meet you.  you've always been here for me, so it's only fair if i do the same.\"  it was around this time that the waiter came to deliver our meal that i got an idea.  i asked kaylee if she would mind coming back home to eat and talk more--she said yes. \n\nwe sat in the living room and talked for a long time about things. i expressed to her all of my worries of that night.  i told her of how i was afraid of losing her; i told of how i was conflicted over my past.  she listened intently and would comment on some remarks.  she would say things like, \"you're not alone,\" and \"you think too much!\", and the best one, \"quit being so stupid!\"  after a while, i got up the courage to ask her the question i had been thinking about the past three days.\n\n\"what will happen to us?\"  to which she said, \"i'm going to give you some time to find yourself.  you know where to find me and you know that i will help.  i hope that you will let me help this time.  i didn't know what i would do with myself when i left three days ago.  you were the rock in my life and i was lost.  but don't think you'll get me back so easily!\"\n\ngod, i love her so much.  \"don't worry.  i won't give up on love this time.\"\n\n**tl;dr of 5-hr post:**  i met with her at the restaurant we first met.  we decided to take the food home with us to eat it.  at home we expressed to each other what we had been feeling for the past three days.  i told kaylee how i was foolish for saying what i said that night.  she told me she would always be there for me and that she missed me; however, she told me that i'd have to get her back again, which i do not mind.  better than nothing!\n\n**edit:** i just want to express a heartfelt thanks to everyone who took the time out of their days to offer their support to me.  it really makes me happy to know that the internet and reddit can really be a place to console people when they're feeling down.  there's no way i could pay you guys back but in my deepest gratitude.  i will keep posting updates if they are still desired, but, hopefully, the fuck-up should be resolved.  hopefully!  i don't want to take anything for granted!\n\n*~9 hours after post:* kaylee and i will be taking a day off from work to hang out.  i still feel really bad about what happened, so i'm going to try my hardest to never let it happen again.  i think i'll show kaylee this op tomorrow and see what she thinks.  i really appreciate all of the support i've been getting!\n\n*~18 hours after post:*  i decided to show kaylee the op.  she read it for around 30 minutes, comments and edits included.  she then asked me if she could add a part to this op, so here is what she's saying (i'm going to read it after it's posted, i'm giving her the benefit of the doubt!).  after this, kaylee and i are going to the park.  she said she wanted to talk about something important, so i guess we'll all see what she's talking about soon!\n\n**kaylee:**  hey reddit!  the first thing that comes to my mind is just a big \"wow!\"  i've never used this site before and i've only seen it occasionally thru social media.  there's so much i could say right now, but i think the biggest thing that i have to say is thanks!  you guys were there for john when i wasn't (i'm still upset with myself about not being there for him) and when he needed company the most.  i know he might not be the most charming, forward, or confident person out there... but he sure is damn thoughtful, kind, caring, and awesome!  i hope that some of you guys saw that in his thread!  also, i'm not some perfect angel!  he compliments me way too much!!  i'm just a normal girl with problems as well.  i think some of my issues were seen four days ago as well.  i think you guys reserve this forum for \"fuck-ups,\" and, well i think i messed up as well.  thanks again, reddit!\n\n**~23 hours after post:  i can't believe it's been nearly a whole day since i decided to make the op.  i don't regret a second of it.  reddit has been so kind to me.  to update, i think the bond i have with kaylee has only gotten stronger.  the argument we had has only seemed to solidify how we really feel about each other.  we had a long talk about my past and i ended up telling her everything about my past in detail.  when i finished, she did not respond with words.  it was painful to relive and recount memories i had tried to put behind me, but i'm glad it's out of the way now.  i'm fully ready to accept the past and to overcome any lingering doubt.  i asked her if she thought i was crazy or needed to see a therapist, and she told me something so sweet i cannot help but quote.**\n\n**\"you're fine just how you are.  the past may be a part of you, but it will never ever control you again.  we'll make sure of it.\"**\n\n**i feel like i am re-experiencing every single happy moment of the past 6 years i've spent with kaylee over again.  i'd love to remember that past more than my old past.**\n\n**a huge thank you to every single person out there that's supported me in my difficult journey since yesterday.  my life has been such a roller coaster and i'm really not used to it being like that.  i'm so grateful for all the advice people have been giving me.**\nSummary:  This story started with a man who had regrets from the previous night and was looking to mend them with his girlfriend who he had met a couple of years",

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: a long time ago (4 years ago), in a galaxy far far away (a small college town in rural kentucky)...\n\ni went to a small school of 1200 students, in a small town of 3000 people. i was part of the film program, who got along with the local community fairly well. as long as you didn't get in the way of traffic and were respectful, you could get away with filming wherever you needed to. it was nice.\n\nso the story begins when i was cinematographer for another student's short film. we were required to help on each other's projects as part of class work, and so while i always thought the guy was a bit of an airhead, i didn't have much choice. it's typical crappy film student story - in spite of having no budget to make it look good, he wants action scenes, a car chase, a gun shoot out, etc. whatever. i'll work with it.\n\nso we get through the first few days and get to the final shoot out which takes place in a parking lot near the downtown area. next to a bank, which he wants as the back drop. yeah. to be fair, its a small town so everything closes at 5 in the afternoon so even though its light out, the bank has been closed for a good hour. this also isn't the first time anyone has filmed with prop guns in the area - but the common sense thing to do is to always let the police know ahead of time. i had double and triple checked with the director that he had called in to the police and he assured me it was fine.\n\nlies.\n\nso this is a small shoot with no lights, no big camera gear, and other than a handful of crew standing to the side, not much to speak of that would look like a film set. we start filming as our armed actors walk towards the bank, and less than 45 seconds into our first take, we hear sirens. the director cuts, as 4 police cars (so all of the town's police cars) pull in and promptly arrest everyone. \n\nwhat we didn't know is that literally the week before, another nearby town had been robbed at the same time of evening. apparently, there were still employees in the bank we were filming, who were understandably in a complete panic thinking that they were being robbed. needless to say we were all taken to the police station in handcuffs and it took a good 6 hours before everyone was cleared. if it weren't for the head of our film department showing up and apologizing profusely it might have even been longer.\n\nthe director was of course in enormous trouble and the film department suffered horribly from the incident. students have to get film permits for anything not on campus. i've been gone for 4 years and when i visited campus a few months ago to see old faculty, they said there are still students talking about it and how horrible it still is for the school's reputation with the local community.\nSummary:  we got arrested. because we filmed a shoot in front of a closed bank. and apparently a robbery had occurred at that same bank the previous week,",

 we get down outside and in a taxi and they show me....someone else's bag!! mistake 7.  i tell them it's not mine and i grab it to take it back in, hop out of the car get tangled in the bag straps at my feet, slip on the wet curb and faceplant.  i seriously brained myself, at least that's what i was told because i don't really remember much at this point, just that my face is going to really hurt.\n\nnext thing i know i am in this couples home apartment after a taxi ride that was god knows how long, covered in blood standing in a shower, cleaning myself up.  when she comes in and takes me to bed, now i am trying to pleasure this woman, not bleed on everything, and not pass out from over-inebriation / loss of blood.  it wasn't my best performance, but it wasn't my worst performance either.  ended up copulating for awhile, passing out until morning, doing it one more time before putting on my wet, blood-stained clothes and finding my way to the hostel.\n\ni've slept nearly 24 hours now.  i've noticed two black eyes slowly forming, i'm not sure if my nose is busted but it is definitely wrecked.  i've got two fat lips, and my teeth, all the ones in front, seriously ache.  on top of that, when i made it back to the bar, the bag wasn't there, i returned the other bag to the police station, spent an hour filling out a police report with people who didn't speak english and am now writing this on the hostel-shared computer before catching a flight home.  i have no hopes of getting my stuff back; i had my whole life on that computer.  to make matters worst, i am flying back to the states with the hopes of getting a job (currently jobless) in a new city and now have a pretty ugly mug for a couple of interviews.  i thought i knew what rock-bottom felt like, but today i feel like i've reached a new low.  fuck you october 2017 and fuck you tokyo.\nSummary: ingested alcohol, lost my bag, got my self all messed up, took a trip to tokiyo that resulted in no stuff, no job",

and ever since we were young wed play a tad bit too rough usually ending up in my getting hurt.  iight so boom boring ass saturday waiting for the fights to start just chilling when i decide hmm i'm gunna try to kimura his leg( not a thing but fuck it bored as hell right) so during said scramble on his bed the bottom half of my body rolls off and my right knee smashes the wine glass and boy this i where it really starts.\n\nso as i'm falling i feel the glass break and then i feel pain but i manage to spin over onto the floor away from it so that the whole spine doesn't go through my knee, but i still got cut pretty damn deep.  after my little spin all i can do is scream which alerts my mother and her friend and now everyone's freaking out trying to tie my leg off because its gushing at this point, me i'm just worried about some socks.  anyways they put two tourniquets on right above my knee and one slightly below but on the bigger gash.  i somehow manage to shimmy down the stairs into my moms friends car and take a nice bumpy ride to the er.  arriving at the er and getting settled in wasn't the bad part what happened when the doctor showed up.  he removed the tourniquets, thush throwing away my right sock cause it touched the blood or whatever then my moms like hmm might as well throw away the left one too so now i'm sock less in a cold ass er.  back to the main story tho so they apply a couple pieces of gauss and some medical tape then boom have me wait to get some xrays.  with my luck i get stuck next to two older religious jamaican ladies who are super talkative and i'm just not feeling it already, also ones slightly delirious.  so after like a half hour of pain and listening to their banter the doctor pulls up rolls me into the er hall( i'm on a stretcher at this point) so he leaves me in the xray hall out comes another guy who's english is barely existant to push me on into the room with the cold ass steel table with a little sheet sitting on it like yea thats gunna protect me from the cold,but he locks the stretcher right next to the table and i slide over immediately my knee is pulsating with pain.  when i'm on the table the xray guy rips my toes and just forces my whole leg to where he wants it and leaves to take the picture all the while saying hey dont move at all normal except for when i'm in pain and can't control my leg at all.  he takes the first picture and comes back in for the second and i don't even know how to explain it the position but its some sideways shit in which he yet again forces my leg into place before saying dont move at all and takes the picture.  sorry of its repetitive i'm better at telling stories from my mouth.  next he slides me back onto my stretcher and wheels me back into the hallway and my knee is just leaking through all the gauss but its weird there's not much pain.\n\nan orderly comes to wheel me right back next to the two older women and oh they throw a fit about the blood and how i could die and that gets my mom riled up and looking for someone to repackage the wound.  the guy who shows up is cool but with my leg getting worse the whole having to lift it up and go under was just not pleasant (also not a single pain med in sight),my toes are going numb from the cold and basically dying of hunger.  but oh it doesn't end there i sit next to the ladies for about an hour and a half while all the doctors go on break and chit chat in a circle about whatever it is they talk about then in pops in the night shift the ladies next to me are just super talkative and telling stories not pertaining to their injuries to the doctors who took over so that was pretty annoying to hear.  in walks in trainee doc and the one training him, they basically tell me hey so surgery is most likely gunna need to happen to get the glass out and stitch it up from the inside too i'm like cool whatever let's get it done but nah first they have to clean the wound.  i'm down like ok pretty normal they wheel me into the special trauma room thing and i'm just like uhh ok then whatever. the trainee cuts the bandage off and starts pouring this super cold liquid onto it not gunna lie was both a pleasant and unpleasant sensation regular wound cleaning stuff ensues.  then walks in training doctor with a cold face with two fucking gigantic syringes like now its time to pump fluid into it oh fucking great.  the needles where thick as hell also so yea i'm bitching a bit but its warranted.  she pumps the fluid slow at first which makes it all just feel super tight but gets so much worse about half way in.  i'm screaming my head off and in runs my mother trying to comfort me but i'm annoyed as shit cause this pain is just excruciating so i kinda raise my voice to send her outta the room.  then comes the second syringe my knee puffed of so big it was pretty much two times the size of its regular shape and i can't take it anymore so i start to pass out mid syringe just feeling pain and seeing stars basically.  after she's taken it all out the nurse comes in with pain meds and the training doctor kinda looks like what you weren't on anything? i was too grumpy to really do anything except brood while this nurse stabbed me 10 times trying to put an iv in.\nsorry if its long and not very well written,but after that its pretty smooth i nap,it bleeds,i go through surgery and its goes good

(believe it or not that's an important detail for later). for story sake we'll call her cassie.\n\ngod i had such a huge crush on cassie. and she knew i did as well. considering we sat next to each other in 3 classes, she quickly noticed me staring. she didn't seem to care though and we could both comfortably talk to each other on a daily basis. things however changed near the end of the school year. i was sat next to cassie in shop class. however, two of cassie's friends, both of whom i had a distaste for, sat infront of us. they obviously knew of my crush and were constantly teasing me about it right in front of cassie. at first it was minor stuff, you know, \"cassie and milhouse sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g\". it however rapidly escalated.\n\nit soon became veeery detailed and creepy as they asked me how much i'd want to grope her breasts to wondering if i'd braid her pubic hair. 8th grade everyone... this went on for nearly a week and it was just more and more embarrassing and i could tell cassie was reaaally uncomfortable with it. we obviously asked them to stop but that never happened.\n\nfuck up #1\n\nall this anger and frustration being bottled up eventually led to an outburst in which i said some things i shouldn't have. i didn't scream it, but i'm assuming what happened is a teacher passing by caught wind of what i'd said. i basically went up to their faces and said \"you're both on my list and i'm gonna gut you with a plastic knife!\" terrifying huh? apparently so. keep in mind the time period this is happening. school shootings were happening like once every other month so ours was constantly on high alert.\n\nfuck up #2\n\nso word gets passed up the ranks and my councilor sends a student to tell me to come to her office. i however was busy building my model rocket in shop class and didn't feel like talking about my feelings with her at that point. fuck up 2.5 (i'd been talking to her for a couple months about being sad and what not). \n\nfuck up #3\n\nso i continue on my rocket. we at the time were also judging other people's rockets so we wrote that down on scratch paper and scored it from 1-30. i leave said judging sheet in my backpack. \n\nabout 10 minutes later, the two officers that patrol our school come into the shop room and walk up to me. they pull me up from my seat, look me straight in the eyes and tell me to come with them now. \n\nso i'm freaking out right now. the cops have me by the arms and are escorting me out of class, in front of everyone, with their hands on their guns. what. the. fuck. so i'm taken to the dean's quarters and it feels like i'm on trial. all the school staff is present. both counselors, the dean, the principal, the superintendent, and even one of the janitors oddly enough.\n\nthey sit me down and the cops stand behind me, hands still on weapons. they all stare me down and the dean asks \"what the hell is going on milhouse?!\" i had no idea what was happening, but then the janitor of all people fills me in on why i'm here. i start breaking down in hysteria thinking i'm being expelled or even going to jail. i even almost pass out at one point because of it. \n\nso, to refresh what the situation is, a kid who's actively sought help for mental health issues has made death threats to other students. and you know how life is in these moments, it just tries to fuck you over more. remember fuck up #3? well they search my backpack and find my \"list\". more than 30 students names with varying numbers next to their names. so, the person they think might be a school shooter has a list of \"targets\". \n\nthe accusations are thrown about for the next hour as i try to explain myself and the \"list\" eventually they get it through their thick skulls that i might be telling the truth about the \"list\" and check with the shop teacher on it. once that's cleared up and i do my best to explain what else has happened, the attitude seems to shift from \"protective brown bear mother\" to \"disappointed dad\". \n\nthankfully this took place 1 week before the summer vacation started so they only gave me 3 days of in school suspension with nothing written on my record about the incident. the bullies only got 1 hour of after school detention however. what a great system.\nSummary: ing the post to make a summary.

reddit, help.\n\n \n\nedit: i realized that i was initially updating in the comments section so i'm going to cut and paste them here to make more sense.\n\nupdate: it was 2:37 am eastern time when i originally posted this. \n\nupdate: she's dead to the world - completely asleep. there are like scratching sounds going on right outside the bedroom. i'm a grown, huge, bearded man and just freaked out.\n\nupdate: ok, the scratching noises are coming from the bedroom door jamb. i guess there is some wind infiltration causing the door to shake. i \"bravely\" opened the door and there's no one rattling it or standing there. i did put my pants back on.\n\nupdate:  i know this word is overused but it just seems surreal. like i don't think this beautiful, smart, accomplished woman would lure me to my doom but wtf is going on?\n\nupdate: ok, she stirred. i took the opportunity to ask if there are other people here. she said \"uh huh\". i asked why and she muttered incomprehensibly. i asked how many and she said - i believe this is how you would spell it- \"blorg\". she then held up 4 fingers. i'm thinking she just had a party and everyone is drunk or stoned. still wondering if this can have a happy ending. like a fairytale, not a massage.\n\nupdate: i'm going to try to say goodbye and go.\n\nupdate: i'm alive. after my last comment where i said i was taking people's advice and leaving i reached over and told her i was leaving.  she stirred a bit and when i repeated myself she snuggled up into me and murmured how happy she was that i came over. so i held her and fell asleep.  it's now just before 10 am and i'm still with her in bed.  she's still sleeping.  it sounds like someone is cooking breakfast in the apartment.  sorry this was anticlimactic.  i'll update again when i find out the whole story.\n\nupdate:  as i was i just responding to a comment she woke up.  she kissed me good morning and then went outside of the bedroom to greet the others. apparently there are only two other people and they might be a couple. i still haven't left the bedroom because it is awkward. i detected the smell of alcohol on her breath when she was breathing on me last night before i fell asleep. so i may have an answer. at this moment i hear the 3 of them (1 guy and 2 girls) laughing and making small talk in the kitchen (right outside the bedroom).\n\nupdate:  a little perspective now that the sun is up. she and her friends had a lot to drink at shabbat dinner. she invites me over after midnight not bothering to tell me that other people are here or telling them that i'm coming over. she passes out. the zombies/heroin addicts/organ harvesters that i saw on the floor in the middle of the night are a rabbi and his wife. in the middle of the night when i asked her how many people were here she indicated 4 because she included us in that total. she thinks it's hysterical i wrote about this while also thinking i'm the biggest dork. she did apologize for the weird situation. we're still in bed and she's back asleep. everything is good.\n\nupdate:  it is now 2pm and almost 12 hours have passed since i started this post.  i am home - safe and sound.  i was finally introduced to the rabbi and his wife and they are lovely people - and very young.  put together these 2 people may just about equal my height and weight - yet in my imagination they were enormous, nefarious beings.  i did ask them if they were zombies, heroin addicts, or organ harvesters (or any combination of those) and they assured me that they were not.  they claimed not have been awakened by anything last night - the doorman calling up, me coming in, me slamming the bedroom door, me typing away on my cellphone on reddit all night, etc.  there is a happy ending to all this (not that type of happy ending - yet) the beautiful woman invited me to come over again tomorrow night and assures me that she will be conscious and no one else will be in the apartment.  thanks for the help and the amusing comments, reddit.  you guys are great.\nSummary: ing this seems like some kind of crazy post apocalyptic nightmare. I am trying to decide if I should stay the way things are or try and leave",

(i should note that we used protection every time, and she was honestly a good girl, who only gets involved in long term relationships).\n\ni was surprised at how little guilt i felt when i went home. surely i could have this little fling, keep it from my wife, and go on giving my family everything they could need. well, reddit, i am a naive piece of shit and it blew up in my face tonight.\n\ni fell in love with this girl; i'm not a young boy to confuse real feelings with infatuation, but it happened fast. this beautiful, available girl gave me everything and i was able to be myself with her so easily. i started meeting her family under the pretense that my wife and i were separated, and it was starting to feel normal.\n\nbut i love my wife, and my children, and i could only ever give her 50%. so tonight we made love again, and as we were lying in bed she told me that i was being distant. i told her i was afraid; of hurting her, of never being enough, of hurting somebody, no matter what direction i moved. and it was right there, reddit, in that fucking bed, that we realized we had an expiration date. we talked, and she was so understanding, and i just felt like such an asshole. \n\nin the end, we decided it would be better just to cut it off now, rather than fall deeper in love and have to do it down the road. i could have carried on another fifty years like this; enjoying every moment with her, going home and trying to be a good father. but it wasn't fair to her, to my family, to me, to anybody involved.\n\nhere i am now, sitting in aforementioned bed, alone, painfully missing her prescence. i will give her space, and may even seek work elsewhere to make the healing process easier on her and myself. we knew what we were getting into before we fell in love, and i see no reason to place blame on either of us. i worry for the future though; will the guilt unexpectedly hit me as i lie in bed with my beautiful wife? will i go another twenty years knowing that she was the one who got away?\n\ni deserve to be miserable, to be alone. but even though i am a flawed, careless man, i am still a man. so i will put my feelings aside for her sake, set my jaw a little tighter, and take what lessons i can from this experience.\nSummary: ence was a very difficult situation, where i had to choose between two people i loved. it took me a long time to realize that it couldn't",

the amount of holes companies put in them for potatoes to breath. potatoes don't have lungs why do they need to breathe??\n\nsee, i wanted to just grab the bag and throw it in the trash. but those holes? oh perfect size for thousands of disgruntled fruit flies to attack the dick that tries to deport them from their cozy pantry home. i know if i was a fruit fly and a large bearded bro tried to disturb my gated potato community i would not go lightly. i'd be one fly, patriotic mother fucker.\n\ni paced around my apartment for about 30 minutes before deciding i better be even more scared of this mess and google 'rotten potato maggots.' because that's the sensible thing to do right? nope, wrong.\n\nwhen you google 'rotten potatoes' like the third entry is [an article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2409920/russian-girl-8--orphaned-entire-family-wiped-deadly-gas-caused-rotting-potatoes-cellar.html) about a girl who is now an orphan because rotten potatoes killed her family. i wish i was joking right now. \n\ntl;dr: family kept large amount of potatoes in cellar, potatoes went bad, potatoes release deadly gasses, everyone in the family but the girl went to investigate smell, everyone in family dies. now i have to worry about making my unborn children orphans. as you can imagine it was at this point when i realized that regardless of what fifth harmony claims, potatoes are not worth it, and i'm glad there was a potato famine in ireland at one point. although i wish it would have just wiped out potatoes entirely. it was also at this point i began writing my will, to further distract me from dealing with the situation at hand.\n\nwhich is another thing. i thought about just leaving it, and calling someone later in the day. meh, the flies can chill for awhile right? i also took this time to make sure my gas mask still fit, because apparently i would be needing it. \n\nafter approx an hour of stalling and calming down from the buzzing incident, i began my plan of attack. surely i am not worthy of a beard if i cannot initiate a declaration of war via bug genocide and habitat relocation. the planning had begun.\n\nstep 1. supplies. i decided to not go with the gas mask. if the smell was as bad as my research suggested i did not want to throw up to possibly choke and die like a freshman on prom night who suffers from 'lightweights who pregame too hard.' so a sweatshirt doused in cologne would have to do. i also readied my all purpose cleaner with bleach, paper towels, a kitchen trash bag, and a hefty black garbage bag.\n\nstep 2. elevation. i have two chairs in my apartment. my office chair with scooter wheels that acts like a child with adhd and can't sit still, and my drum stool that has the stability of an elderly person with dementia. obviously both are terrible choices to trust with my life, but i chose the drum stool with dementia as it seemed the lesser of two evils. i tried out my office chair earlier in my first interaction with the potatoes, but i spent more time trying to stabilize than examining the liquid mess.\n\nstep 3. execution. i took the black trash bag and readied it open on the oven door as a second and final seal. i chose a kitchen bag as the first form of contact for the easy close straps, and i wanted to seal that bitch super fast to minimize potential refugees and migrants of the great moldy potato move. \n\ni positioned myself atop the stool and peered on. my heart raced, i wasn't ready in the least (to my credit no one is truly ever ready for war), and the bag was still dripping like a broken tap. \n\ntesting the waters i lifted the bag a little, slower than i did before to get an idea of how many of these things there were. the bag lifted from it's brown, sloppy base and there was one particular potato in front that was the epicenter of fruit fly operations.\n\ntwo thirds of this potato were covered in a white, fungus looking substance, and the final third looked like it did it's best to look like a potato. but if it were in a potato look alike contest, it would not win. like ever.\n\nwithin the bag dozens of mini flies buzzed around, most likely practicing training missions to defend their motherland. below them, future warrior maggots rioted and were wondering why the potatoes were moving. \n\nso it was now or never. i positioned and re-positioned the bag, but every angle was awkward and would give more seconds for the flies to react than i wanted. my face was protected in a south park kenny sort of way, the hood of my sweatshirt tied as tight as it would go, and the strings tied behind my neck to secure the hood in place. cologne filled my nostrils, and i had yet to get a good whiff of the vegetable graveyard before me.\n\ni didn't have gloves either, and i didn't want to touch the liquid for fear of poisoning and/or death. finally i just decided to man up and fuck up these flies' world.\n\nand why shouldn't i? these bitches were on my territory, in my house, trying to live rent and tax free plus they were eating my food? not on my land, fly-bros, this isn't communist china. \n\nso i did my best trump impression, grabbed that sack by the top knot, yelled some racist obscenities and lobbed those squatting mother fuckers into my white disposable trash bag. i strung up that bag like it was a noose sending a message to fruit flies everywhere and proudly wrapped that sack with a hefty black garbage bag lining. \n\nthe flies yelled and hollered, but were unable to escape because surprise bitch trash doesn't need to breathe. \n\ni threw the bag out with a very elitist strut like i just won the war on terror and looked at the brown liquid aftermath in my pantry. \n\ni sprayed probably half  the bottle of all purpose cleaner to avoid the smell, and luckily no food was effected. i threw out some granola and gravy mix that may have been in contact with the potatoes, but there were minimal domestic casualties. \n\noh and that energy drink case i lost? it was on the floor of the pantry and had several droplets of potato sludge over the mouth of a few of the cans, so i scrapped them all out of paranoia.\n\nthere was one can missing from the corner of the case which i drank yesterday, so hopefully my immune system is as strong of a warrior as i am. if not, please write this post on my epitaph. \n\n \n\nedit: breathe\nSummary:  i went into the bathroom, turned on every fan, opened a window, lit a candle, drenched a paper towel in bleach and put it on",

(protip: when puking after eating spicy food, keep your head up so you don't get that nasty stuff in your sinuses.)  after scrubbing my hands thoroughly and splashing my face with water it's back to the purge.  i end up spending about 30 minutes in the bathroom, alternating between filling the toilet and running cold water over my face and hands.  when i finally feel like i can stand without throwing up, i stumble back out and tell my friends they're gonna have to drive me home.\n\nfriends drop me off at home and i try to get some rest.  about 30 minutes after dozing off i wake up to a stabbing pain in my right side, like someone is trying to twist a corkscrew into my liver.  i end up sitting in the shower for about 30 minutes with cold water running over me while i continue to question my life choices in between bouts of vomiting.  there is enough capsaicin left in my stomach that it aerosolizes and now my bathroom feels like someone pepper sprayed it.\n\nso, i got a t-shirt and my picture taken, plus the respect/pity of a dozen or so people i've never met and may never see again.  i only missed one day of work and about a week later my digestive tract returned to normal.  later i find out that the manager boosted his wing sauce with some capsaicin extract that's rated at 6,000,000 scoville units or so.  for reference, the hottest \"natural\" pepper sauce is around 1,000,000 scoville units.\nSummary:  I love spicy foods. I recently took on a hot pepper challenge. \n\nQuestion: What is my favorite spicy sauce?\n\nAnswer: Mad Dog 356",

sex that drunk was probably just a bunch of fumbling and then passing out. at some point in the middle of the night i wake up because i realize i have to pee, and it also occurs to me that i may have started my period. i grab my bag and head to the bathroom- or so i think. somehow in my groggy and still wasted state i've exited the room into the hallway instead of the bathroom and i'm now standing in the hallway in his t shirt knocking on the door to be let back in but nothing. i call his cell 50 times and no answer so i find a bathroom on the floor and then head down to the front desk to try to get a key to back into the room. as i am not listed as a guest they can not let me back in, and he's not answering his room phone either. i know the room number, but it's booked under a work account (i find out later) so my friends name is not associated with the room and the man at the front desk is convinced that i'm making the name up and just fucked some dude whose name i don't know. i am extremely agrivated and the super judgmental guy at the desk says i can leave now or he is going to call the cops. i do not want the cops involved so i do the most horrific walk of shame back to my car and sleep in the back seat for a few hours. \n\nif only the story ended there. \n\ni wake up and am feeling mostly sober and already very hungover so i decide the best plan is to drive the 2 miles home to my apartment and sleep off my shame. i know i shouldn't be driving, but i figure it's like 4am on a saturday morning and it's such a short distance that i can make it safely, right? my apartment is behind a shopping center and frequently cut through the parking lot to get to my building. i can see my building and picture how great it going to be to shower and get into my own bed. whoop whoop- flashing lights. cop car. i didn't see them in the dark parking lot, and must have rolled the stop sign. they come up to my window and i can only imagine how horrible i looked. make up smeared everywhere, hair used to be in a fancy up-do but has been through some drunk sex and then i slept in my backseat, no pants and no shoes just a large mens t shirt, panties and pearls... they ask how much ive had to drink and i respond honestly that i don't know, but try to explain that i was drinking yesterday not today! this technicality does not matter, and they ask me to do a field sobriety test. i fail. to be fair, im not sure i can to most of these tasks stone sober but between the amount im probably still drunk, the pending hangover and the panic attack im about to have there was no fucking chance i was pulling this off and i get arrested. surprisingly, the breathalyzer puts me right below the legal limit, but the not being able to walk in a straight line or point to my own nose with any skill ruined any hope i had of going home. \n\nsince we are right on the line between two cities i am not taken where i expect to end up- the cute little holding cell downtown i had seen as a teenager who got a warning for smoking some pot at a concert, i'm taken to the county facility on the edge of my town. i get put into a cell with straight up crack heads and hookers and i probably look worse than they do. they are yelling at me and making fun of me and i am freaked out and don't think i can handle being in this room. i've heard from a friend that if you pretend you are suicidal they put you in a private, albeit padded, cell so i pull out all the stops and go full on drama class. it was an oscar worthy performance and it works! a female officer addresses my concerns and takes me out of the smelly scary cell... and then proceeds to give me a complete cavity search, restrains me and put me back in the same shared cell, but now under psych watch and the center of attention for my cell mates. turns out this facility doesn't have an open room for me to be alone so i'm going to be there till monday when a councilor can address my mental health issues instead of being processed on saturday for release. fml.\nSummary: ingrid and jason were at my wedding. we had so much fun. but then jessica and matt left and so did ingrid.",

i mean they were colored, they were african american, etc.) girls standing up and walking toward me. the one on the left called out to me, ordering to look at them (i had been facing down, just looking at the floor). meanwhile, the girl on the right took out a knife from her backpack and began to sway it around all while trying to be intimidating. \n\nit was at this point where i raised my head, looked at the girl with the knife and i made up my mind. at that exact moment, the girl on the left (and the smartest of the two) realized what was going to happen and promptly grabbed her friend and ordered her to put away the knife. \n\nshe then reached into her pocket and brought out two bus tokens, saying something along the lines of \u201chere you can get on another bus\u201d. i knew that whether or not i took those tokens was irrelevant, they were all going to keep beating me until their bus stop came up. my anger was still there but my mind had come back a bit. so i began to buy some time by reaching for them but retracting away twice. \n\nthankfully this paid off, the bus had come to a stop on a red light. both exits were being blocked of course and even if they weren\u2019t, the closest door (back door) still had to be unlocked by the driver in order for me to open it (they were manual doors back then). my only exit was one of the emergency ones.\n\ni grabbed both tokens and promptly made a wide arc with my arm, throwing them in random directions. i then jumped onto the seats where the girl and \u201cmy friend\u201d were on, pulled the window\u2019s latch and pushed myself out. of course they tried to grab me but they were only left with my sweater.\n\nthinking i might be followed, i ran and took a long convoluted path home. i took a shower, ate, played some video games and went to sleep.\n\n \n\n after that i began to be bullied, not by either the black girls or the cholas but by completely unrelated people and groups. i stopped being a \u201cgood student\u201d and began to deal with the \u201cunderground\u201d side of the school. those stories aren\u2019t fuck ups but i\u2019ll just say that i got involved in a lot of cliques, crews/gangs and there was plenty of drama, betrayals, intrigue, and fights (both with fists and knifes) to make a multiple season tv series. \n\ni might post 2 other notable fus from my school years down the road. don't worry though i'm fine today and im a good and productive member of society today.\nSummary:  A post describes the events of a day in middle-school. A group got mad at you for no apparent reason and you got beaten up in public.",

what would be the easiest thing to sell that wouldn't impact my daily routine and cause me to do a crazy amount of work on top of the already high work load?\n\nit was right in front of me the whole time! i could sell digital keys for online games! i already knew a wholesaler that i could buy from in bulk and i would be able to sell the digital keys at a \u00a32-\u00a35 profit margin depending on the game.\nso i bought 70 digital copies to get me started knowing that they would sell easily as they sell like hotcakes on other selling websites including ebay. before i made any listings on ebay i had to make my paypal account a business one and i also had to make a phonecall to ebay to get my listing limits raised, they also asked me what my \"business plan\" was - i told them it in great detail and they were happy with what i was doing and wished me luck.\n\ngreat - i thought. it seemed like everything was going smoothly so i put my first listing up on ebay. they sold very fast, i was able to sell 64 copies in 8 days turning over $3245 and making about $240 in profit, amazing! i thought - if i could keep it up for a whole month i could make about $1000 a month, the idea of moving in together with my girlfriend seemed closer than ever..\n\nuntil..\n\n\nthe first chargeback came through. completely unaware of chargebacks i began to google around and i came to the conclusion they were fairly common and with this in mind and believing that paypal would surely have good security measures in place etc etc, i thought that by submitting all the evidence that i had of a legitimate transaction had actually taken place i would be able to prove that this person did indeed buy the digital good from me or at least i would be covered.\n\nnope.\n\nafter i had submitted the lengthy explanation, photos, etc. my dispute instantly was closed and they buyer was refunded. gobsmacked - i then decided it's best to phone up and ask what the hell is going on. they tell me to just upload as much information as i have ad they will fight the case for me. i think the whole thing is bs but do what they as. little did i know that this wouldn't be the only chargeback.. i am currently sitting with 17 chargebacks against my paypal account, paypal charge \u00a314 for every chargeback made against an account and i've also lost every single one of the disputes. as far as i can see i won't be getting my money back, i've phoned them up countless times, including my bank none of witch say they can help me. i've even contacted the police and gave over all the details that the scammers have signed up with. many of the addresses that paypal had confirmed did not even exist! i couldn't believe it, almost all of the people that i have spoken to about this didn't even know (like myself) that paypal don't cover digital goods even though they promote how great they are and how secure they are.\n\n(if you google \"selling digital goods paypal\" you'll see what i mean)\n\ni've done some research on the scam in question and it seems very easy to perform. basically, the people buying sign up with paypal and fake.. everything, somehow get their account confirmed by paypal with their fake address and then with whatever bank they are with they make as many purchases as possible at their local wifi spot, mcdonalds for example and then a week later they will phone their bank and claim it was stolen and was used to buy x number of items online. this is just one of the many ways to get around paypals security and commit fraud.\n\nthe issue with this is that because they use paypal as a middle man, i cannot get any information about the buyer at all meaning they are completely hidden and there's nothing i can do to stop them from robbing my personal bank account and in the law eyes it's completely legal!? paypal are affiliating a scam online and they don't really care much about it because it's making them money and refuse to offer digital goods cover because they have poor security measures in place.\n\nmy main issue with all this is that i've been scammed and theres nothing in place to get any help. it's totally mind blowing that this is allowed to happen and paypal are allowed to go on doing business without answering for their poor security checks\n\ni refuse to believe in the short 8 days i was selling for that 17 of the sales were either, stolen credit cards or hacked accounts even the police and many of the members of paypal were saying that does seem very unlikely - its because it is! i was scammed but they wont help me and i will never get my money back or any justice and that is what angers me most. it's been on my mind constantly since the first chargeback 2 months ago and since then it has seriously impacted my life:\n\ni had a small accident on the road that cost me $1000 to repair the damage just a week after the first chargeback (i've never been in an accident before this)\n\ni've had to take many hours out of my work to make phone calls to the bank / paypal / police.\n\ni've just in general been feeling really down about the whole thing and it's been depressing me.\nSummary:, my post has been about a horrible experience i recently had with a digital scam that was allowed by a poor payment system. the system is very poorly",

getting sick and having to call out because there was a nasty stomach bug going around, and my son had it only a few days ago.  however, at this point i feel like i dodged the bullet.\n\nso, i'm working an evening shift, and i head to the break room to take my break.  i had leftover \"tater tot surprise.\"  i also had a cup of coffee, because i love me some coffee.\n\nafter this, things... changed.  there was this subtle jabbing pain in the pit of my stomach, as if i had indigestion.  no big deal, i probably just ate too fast or drank too much coffee.  i go to help unload a freight truck and the jabbing gets worse, and then... it started.  that queasy, insidious, gross sensation of being nauseous.  i'm still praying that i had just had too much coffee or something, but it continued to build.  finally i turned to one of my co-workers and said \"dude, at some point tonight i'm gonna throw up, i can feel it.\"  he asked if i needed to sit down and have a glass of water and i said no, it's probably a bug, but i am going to try and finish out my shift.\n\nunloading the truck and stocking shelves became more and more difficult as my stomach continued to churn.  after an hour it was just moment after unbearable moment and i realized i simply could not do this anymore.  i went to the freight supervisor and said \"i am so sorry but i cannot do this for you, i am going to be sick.\"  she had a deer in the headlights look and said \"well, okay, just let the front manager know.\"\n\ni went to the front end manger and said i needed to leave right now, because i was going to be sick.  she said \"okay, do you think you can pull and count your drawer first?\"  i had been running a spare cash register earlier.  i agreed, because it was an extra fifteen minutes pay for sitting down, no big deal right?\n\ni take my drawer into the office.  at this point my entire experience of reality itself is colored by a wall of gross nausea.  i sit down and start counting, and after a minute i am literally doubled over clenching my stomach, counting with my other hand.\n\ni was about to blow my friggin cookies.\n\ni called the front end manager in.  once she stepped through the door i bolted.  no explanation about the half-counted money.  i just ran.\n\nnow here's where i fucked up-- there was a small trash can by the door of the office.  i thought very briefly about grabbing it on my way out but i didn't.  i figured that stopping and puking in a little trash can would be embarrassing, which is funny considering how things turned out.\n\nthe bathrooms were about a hundred feet away, through the grocery back stock room.  i'm half running, half power walking.  my stomach is screaming.  with only twenty feet to go, my stomach had had enough, and the first wave of dinner went to the top.  i clenched my mouth shut but **it shot out my nose** and traveled several feet across the room, leaving a line of delectable tater tots and corn all along the floor.  it turns out, this particular virus was known for causing projectile vomiting, or as one of my friends called it, power puking.\n\nnow, my nose is on fire and i can see the bathrooms only ten feet away, but my stomach has already gone into full evacuation mode, and no force on heaven or earth could stop it.  i lunged towards the door, and as i did so, my abdomen wrenched and another round of dinner flew out of my mouth.  it pretty much covered the entire door from eye-level down.\n\nat this point i had given up all hope of containing my stomach.  someone was going to have to clean up a mess whether they liked it or not.  i shoved the door open and had a split-second decision-- the sink, the urinal, or the toilet.  the toilet was in the far corner of the room, so that was out of the question.  the sink was right next to me, but it would be impossible to clean.  so... the urinal.\n\nmy abdomen wretched and i just fell to my knees and let it happen.  i have never seen so much food fly out of my mouth in so little time.  the wretches were excruciating, and i made this loud primal moan with each one.  this was loud enough for folks outside to hear, and a group of confused and disgusted co-workers gathered outside the puke-covered door.\n\nin the end, i had spewed vomit over everything except the urinal.  i think maybe one piece of corn made it in there.  otherwise i had basically trashed the place with my own bodily fluids.\n\ni attempted to start cleaning the mess but the front manager came in and said no, go home, don't worry about coming in tomorrow.  i was fucking humiliated because now everyone and their brother would know about the guy who power-puked all over the men's bathroom.\n\nmy pants and shirt were covered with puke.  i wiped myself down as best as i could and left without punching out.  this was in new england during that polar vortex, so it was a toasty -10f when i walked to my car, which i had not had time to start.  the wet pukey-ness froze to my clothes and i shivered and chattered and moaned all the way home.  i'm surprised i didn't cause an accident.\n\ni went in the door without even saying hi to my so, i just basically said that i puked all over myself and needed a shower.  when i got to the bathroom, i realized i was too weak to stand up under hot water for any length of time, so i curled up in the tub while the shower was going.  thus began a long and very miserable night where i almost had to go to the er for moderate dehydration, since i could not even keep a sip of water down.\nSummary: ing

how much more could she do? we had to know.\n\nkeep in the back of your mind from this point on that jenna was expected to be home in a number of hours, as she needed to attend her little sister's 8th birthday party. for some reason, this was the last thing on our minds, and so we pushed her to take another. this one took a little convincing. jenna was carrying a bag of pistachios from the store, which we immediately began threatening to take away unless she took another. she kept saying that we knew she could if she wanted to, but that wasn't enough for us. one of my friends began slowly pouring out the pistachios onto the ground as we walked while holding a sealed bottle out with the other hand. at this point, if i'm honest, she still clearly kind of wanted to show off, and so she took it. she didn't care about the nuts, we stole them anyways, and it wasn't until the 4th shot where things started to get pretty fucked up.\n\nallow me to preface this next section with the fact that my friends and i were also a drunk at this point, but that does nothing to excuse what happened. before shot 4, shit started to get real weird. one of my buddies went full rape mode for a sec, and had jenna down to just her bathing suit (i have no idea why she was wearing a bathing suit). keep in mind that this is next to a baseball field in a relatively public area in the middle of the fucking day. she was rather hopelessly resisting as my friend fully stripped her of her top. i know it should have happened way sooner, but this is when i temporarily dropped a fat n o p e all over the situation. i played the \"you can't fucking do that here, look where we are\" card, and got at least some of her clothes back on. it seems like that's where it should have ended, but for some reason all 3 of us just entirely lacked any sort of moral compass. god knows why, but we wanted her to take another. i don't even remember what was said, but it doesn't really matter. after about 2 minutes, i slumped over to the sidelines while my friends persisted to force yet another bottle of mint extract on her. of course, she drank it.\nthis was really the point of no return. for the next hour or so, jenna went full ragdoll on us. she couldn't stand or walk, and couldn't say anything that made any real sense. the worst part is that it was all just a complete joke to us. we thought it was so fucking funny that this was happening. there was just some indescribable sense of \"i can't believe what we're doing right now\" as we carried this completely blacked out middle school girl through the parking lot back towards the grocery store. we plopped her into a cart for easier mobility as we charted out our next plan of action.\n\nwe managed to get ahold of one of jenna's friends who also had no idea what to do. jenna kept mumbling that she needed to go to the bathroom, so we had her friend take her. we literally just wheeled her into the store and kind of dumped her out of the cart in front of the bathroom door. afterwards, we got her back in, but then she started to draw attention from a large group of people from our school. probably 10 total kids were just circled around her, not even 5 feet from the entrance, and they were all making a scene and asking what was going on. thinking this was too risky, we decided to relocate her to just outside of the entrance at the table we usually would drink at. again, how all of this went unnoticed by an adult figure of any kind is completely beyond me.\nwe decided to wait it out for a bit outside the store, and she started to gain a bit of consciousness after about 45 minutes. she was able to stand, and able to know that she needed to be home in the next hour to get to her little sister's birthday. somehow, this became our primary objective. for whatever fucking reason, we thought if she just got to the birthday party, it would be all good. i don't know man. at any rate, we didn't know where she lived specifically, we just knew she was somewhere in the huge web of apartment complexes across the street. with unparalleled judgement, we decided she was fully prepared to walk across the busiest street in the town and then find her way home on her own. we watched from the side nearest the store as she slowly bobbled across the street. she completely ate shit into the median, which is when we started yelling \"stay! stay!\" in hopes that she would not attempt to cross in front of the wall of cars which was now heading her direction. this is actually the only point in time where an adult came into play. a dude pulled up by us, and was about to turn onto the main road when he saw her. he rolled the window down and looked to us, he asked \"hey guys, is she joking or...?\" to which we responded with \"hahaha nah dude i don't think she's joking.\" the man stopped for a moment, looked to her, looked to us, looked at his phone, and then drove away without a word. we watched jenna stumble the home stretch across the road when the coast was clear, and then decided that we pretty much did a good job.\n\nafter about 20 minutes back at the store, we decided it would probably be a good idea to check on her (how compassionate). we called her maybe 6 times, and when she answered, the only audible thing she could say was \"i'm in the field\". unfortunately, there was like a million fucking fields in this part of town, so we just decided to start where we last saw her. fortunately for us, she left a nice little trail of belongings. shoe here, bathing suit strap there, a bracelet, and then finally, jenna face down in her own vomit in someone's yard. we got her to stand and start directing us to her house, which she was surprisingly able to do. we weaved through the complex for maybe 10 minutes. at one point, she stumbled into a parked car, breaking off their rear view mirror in the process. when we finally got to her house, she was too drunk to get the key into the lock. i did it for her, let her in, handed back the key, and then shut the door and left.\n\nmany hours later, i receive a call from jenna, who is in the er. she tells me she's been there all night, and that she had to have her stomach pumped. she tells me that her mom came home to find her on the floor of the shower in all of her clothes with cold water running on her. she tells me she remembers nothing, and that the doctor said she very well could have died.\n\nso yes, kitchen extracts will no doubt get you drunk. take it from me though, it's fucking awful and desperate. i'm not saying any shit like this would happen to you, but it made me realize how fucking stupid i was, and how only someone that stupid would think it's a good idea to get high off kitchen ingredients. i am so so lucky nobody got hurt, and even more lucky i didn't get caught. to this day i never understand how i was able to pull of such a moronic and evil stunt.\nSummary: 18-year old me was given the sentence \"throwaway\".

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: this happened about 5 years ago. \n\nmy best friend and i had plans to go over to her new co-workers' home for dinner. i had never met her co-workers before and i was excited to hang out. we were out getting some wine and a dish to bring and i wanted to stop by the apartment of my then boyfriend (now husband, surprisingly, as you'll soon see). i needed to go #2 and really didn't want to do that at the home of my friend's friends whom i had never met. doesn't make the best first impression.\n\nmy boyfriend was at work but i had a key. we stopped in and i did my business as usual. as i went to flush, i encountered a situation. no matter how hard i tried, i could not get the stuff to go down. i flushed and flushed and plunged and plunged and it seemed to only be getting worse. nothing was going down and a lot of water had accumulated, making vigorous plunges a dangerous move.\n\nafter about ten minutes or so, my friend knocked on the bathroom door, \"are you okay?\"\n\ni opened up and revealed my situation. my friend nonchalantly entered the bathroom, assessed the situation, grabbed the plunger, and valiantly attempted to plunge my shit down the toilet. please note that you don't find friends like that just anywhere.\n\nunfortunately, after a number of plunges and the same amount of shit, we realized we were fucked. we had no idea what to do. we took the back off the toilet but didn't really know what we were looking for. we searched for some sort of toilet unclogging product in the apartment but came up empty handed. by this point, we were running pretty late for the dinner and my friend was getting texts from her coworkers asking where we were. she dodged the questions and let them know we would be there soon. i briefly contemplated leaving the mess but i knew my boyfriend would have been furious, and let's be honest, it's a really shitty thing to do (pun 100% intended).\n\nthen, light bulb. i remembered my sister telling me how she had been in a similar situation and had some sort of home remedy. i called her immediately and she instructed me to dump some liquid dish soap with boiling water into the toilet and let it sit. that would break up the clog and then i should be able to flush and be on my way. \n\nso we boiled some water and added it to the watery, shitty mess that was in the toilet. i squeezed a hearty amount of dish soap in as well and then my friend and i went outside to have a much needed smoke.\n\nwe waited for about 15 minutes and then went to go flush. now mind you, the toilet was already pretty full when we added the water and soap, so we were running a big risk in flushing and adding more water. however, my sister sounded so confident about her dish soap method that we felt good about engaging in that flush. \n\nwe looked at each other, and then the moment of truth. i placed my finger on the cold handle, took a deep breath, and pushed.\n\n\"shit.\"\n\nliteral shit. nothing went down. instead, soapy, bubbly, frothy shit water started rising. bubbles upon bubbles upon bubbles rose and popped, and with them, the smell of pomegranate-scented dawn mixed with human feces filled the room. panic set in as the water level rose even higher, hitting the brim of the toilet, poised to run over and unleash a tidal wave of some of the weirdest shit mess i could imagine. \n\ninstinctively (because, you know, we all have inborn instincts for situations just like these), i ran into the kitchen and saw a jack in the box cup, likely leftover from my boyfriend's lunch. i ran into the bathroom and filled the cup with bubbly poop water. my friend found another one somewhere and dutifully followed suit. i ran out of the bathroom and to the back balcony and dumped it over, praying it landed on the bush below and not the neighbors deck (although in all honesty, i'm sure there was splash factor i didn't have time to consider. if you are those downstairs neighbors who opened your back door five years ago and thought you smelled shit and dish soap and had some unidentifiable flecks on your deck, i'm sorry. i really am. it was a dire situation. i hope you'll forgive.) \n\nwe spent the next 15 minutes or so filling cups with what we affectionately deemed \"poop juice\" and running outside to dump them off the balcony onto the bush. back and forth we went, cup after cup, gag after gag, screaming at times, laughing at others, and nearly vomiting with each dump (hey, it's another bathroom pun for everyone -- you're welcome). nelly's \"pimp juice\" started playing in my head as i ran back and forth. the cups were starting get soggy  and our patience with the situation was running thin, but we just kept going. i got tunnel vision and all i could see was jack in the box cups with poop juice and a very angry boyfriend. my heart raced and adrenaline coursed through my veins. to be honest, i think i even got a little rush from the whole situation. sure, l fucked up, but look at me, kicking ass and taking names. fuck you, poop juice. you don't get to win this one.\n\n eventually, the remaining poop juice had dropped to a less dangerous level and we were able to get rid of the jack in the box cups. since the toilet no longer appeared to be in danger of a complete overflow, we decided to cut our losses and head over to the dinner. i sent my boyfriend a message briefly explaining what he would later walk into (\"hey babe. how's your day? i love you so much. can't wait to see you. oh by the way, i had a little incident earlier today. nothing big. but there is a little soap in the toilet. mixed with a little shit. and some water. don't worry about it -- it's cool. you're the best.\")\n\n\nwe had a great time at the dinner. my friend's coworkers were cool enough that we were actually able to tell them the whole story and laugh about it. \n\nand my boyfriend forgave me (obviously, as we are now married, and he only brings up \"the incident\" on very special occasions). he said when he got home from work a few hours after the incident he was able to plunge once and get the toilet unclogged. he claims it was his strength and exceptional plunging skills. my stubborn ass maintains it was the soap and hot water that helped; we just needed to let it sit a little longer.\nSummary:  my bestfriend and I went over her coworker's home. We were about to drink wine. I had to use the restroom and could n",

it basically was a mad men style meeting room in the back of the country club that had a table in the corner for serving that had a long table cloth. perfect for crawling under and snoozing! \n\na typical sunday would go like this. arrive at work- hungover and slog through the first part of my shift. grab all the yummies that i could and scarf it down like a famished beast. grab linens and napkins and stride purposefully down to the board room for an equally delicious nap. i would crawl under the table in this deserted room and partially undress (no one ever used in on sundays) and then take a sleeps, setting my alarm. afterwards i would emerge from this room, perfectly well rested and ready for the rest of the day. it was- simply put- fucking awesome. the best part of it was that i am generally in a good mood when i woke up, and seeing all of my co-workers sleepy, stanky faces made my secret all the more worthwhile. \n\nhere's where the fuckup begins. so, i ate a huge brunch on my break and then headed down to take a nap. literally just as i started to fall asleep i was startled by the sound of men's voices and the door opening. i peered from underneath the table-cloth and holy shit... there were a bunch of fancy looking men's shoes. \"shit shit shit this is not good\" i thought. i had never been disturbed while sleeping at work before. my face was like pennywise the clowns when he realizes his own mortality and that the kids can actually injure him. surprise, horror, sheer dismay. \n\nso after several minutes of listening to these pretentious assholes banter about absolutely nothing, i realized that one of them was getting married that afternoon on the lawn of the country club. so, this was kind of a bachelor's pre-game to the festivities. a remarkably sfw pregame however. so, after about ten minutes of absolutely shitting my pants and trying to figure out how the hell i would escape this room before my shift started... my big break came. i watched and heard with delight all of the voices in the room exit! then, silence. \"now's my big chance to get the fuck out of here!\" i thought, as i grabbed my belt, vest, and socks/ shoes and crawled out from under the table. \n\ni realized immediately that i wasn't alone. a catholic priest, dressed in full on catholic priest garb was standing there in the room. obviously, as soon as i emerged from underneath this fucking table he was very startled, crying out and jumping back at the site of this suddenly appearing, disheveled, sleepy-looking, partially clothed hungover man. \n\n\"he's a man of the cloth\" i reasoned \" he will understand my sin of slothfulness\" \n\nin a very quick, 4 sentence spiel and accompanying  hand motions intended to mollify him; i explained that i was taking a nap during my lunch break and give me a second, sorry, and that i would be on my way, no problem! he seems to be baffled, but understands. \n\ni hastily began putting my belt back on. right as my fucking female boss walked in. \n\nshe looked at the priest and looked at me, and i suddenly became very self aware that i was partially clothed- at work- in a room- alone with a catholic priest.\n\nlet's stretch this moment out for the eternity that it was, ok. \n\n her face was stunned, confused, angry, and demanding for an immediate explanation. again i put my hands up in an \"i can explain everything gesture\" and blurted out: \"it's not what it looks like! i was just taking a nap!!!\" \n\n\"taking a nap?\" she asked. \"come see me in my office in 15 minutes.\"\n\nnow, here's 2 things at the time that i did not know. i didn't know that she was my immediate bosses boss. i thought she was in charge of like the floral department or something. major misread of the situation. also, there was no way of knowing this at the time, but she happened to be catholic and that was her priest, making the whole thing a new level of wtf for her when she first came in the room. i found that out later from other employees. \n\nanyway, so i go into her office and she starts just reading me the riot act. i am sitting there, soaking it all up and kind of detaching from the situation. however, during a break in her diatribe she leveled the question at me \" why would you even think to take a nap in the executive board room to begin with?\" \n\ni replied \" well for starters, it's a very cool and quiet place...\" totally being a smart ass, but with a dead-pan delivery. \n\nso, i was mega fired for my nap-crimes against the wealthy and found out that i was somewhat of a legend for my misbehaviors.\nSummary:  I took a nice nap at my job at this countryclub because the staff were all hung over and I was hungry from eating a large brunch.

pick a fight and run away, just like when you ran away killed your friend.*\n\nstupid. the truth of that story was more than i could have imagined. when he was in high school he picked a fight with some kids from another school. they challenged him, and he rounded up all of his friends and drove out there. when they got there they piled out of their trucks to fight the others, and when more showed up they jumped back in to get more themselves. steve jumped in his truck, as they were targeting him for being the instigator, and backed up really fast. in the processes he backed into his best friend, ran over his head, and killed him. as context, i didn't grow up in this small town. i had heard the story through the grapevine and didn't think it was 100% true. it was. i should have known not to say something along those lines. i've never crossed this line before, but steve just got to me. the second i said it i saw the life leave his eyes. even though i never hit him, i saw his eyes well up. i saw that i completely broke him with one sentence, and in the moment, was happy about it. this son-of-a-bitch that has made me feel awful for so long finally gets some of his own medicine.\n\nthat is until the next day when he didn't show up for work. at first i thought nothing of it. this is where i realized i fucked up. that's because he tried to kill himself. i didn't know he was bipolar before i said that to him, but i should have. he showed all of the symptoms, but i just let my anger get in the way and chalk him up to being an asshole. i won't go into details, but his attempt resulted in someone now having to care for him 24/7. i've felt like a total piece of shit since, and probably deservedly so.\n\ni would like to state that i am not going to hurt myself. nor is this a cry for help. it is something that has been weighing heavily on me that i needed to get out, especially since the anniversary is today/tomorrow.\n\n**if you know someone (or you yourself) that needs help please [look at this list of hotlines](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/wiki/hotlines).**\nSummary: 1.

(unless you\u2019re an asshole like me and shouldn\u2019t be in them.)\n\nlike most fuck ups on here, this didn\u2019t happen today. it was a few years ago in fact. to graduate from my school, students needed to do a year long project that had a community service component. one of my best friends-we\u2019ll call him ronnie- decided to do his project on the special olympics, and got his volunteer hours by training with my school\u2019s special olympics team that would be competing in bocce (backyard bowling) in the spring. after a few weeks, ronnie talked me in to volunteering with the team as well. it was fun, fulfilling, and i had some court-ordered community service hours due to a water balloon incident. after months of training with them every week, ronnie and i went to the actual special olympics event with the team to cheer them on. this is where it all went south. while our school\u2019s team was warming up, the coach came up to ronnie and i on the sidelines. i kid you not, this is what she said. \u201cguys, we only have 6 members, and there needs to be 4 on a team to compete. i need you two to play on one of our teams or two kids aren\u2019t going to get to play. yup. we were just as surprised. apparently when the coach signed up our school, she said there were 8 players, knowing that there were 6. so i guess she planned on ronnie and i taking one for the team the whole time.\n\nso, that was that. ronnie and i pretty much had no choice, because there were two special needs kids that weren\u2019t going to get to compete if we didn\u2019t play on their team. so ronnie and i put on sunglasses and walked onto the field with them. in our first match, i don\u2019t think ronnie and i have ever been so uncomfortable. and we\u2019re pretty extroverted. for any who don\u2019t know the rules of bocce, the goal is to roll balls as close as possible to a point on the field, knocking out the other team\u2019s balls if you can to get as many points each round. first to 12 points wins. ronnie and i just sort of lazily rolled the balls because what the fuck else were we supposed to do. however, the two special needs kids on our team had been training for months, and managed to win the game despite ronnie and i not really being 100% invested in the win. right after that win we moved on, and that\u2019s when the tv cameras started trying to interview us. ronnie and i avoided those like the plague. sure, we were willing to compete in the special olympics. but we weren\u2019t about to act mentally disabled for the media. we had morals.\n\nunfortunately, the morals weren\u2019t really that strong. as we kept advancing, ronnie and i sort of got more and more pumped up, fueled by the cheering crowd and the excitement of the two other kids on our team. long story short, by the time we got to the finals our group of 4 was so pumped full of competitive spirit that we won 12-0. i don\u2019t think what we had done really hit us until we were on a podium receiving a medal. \n\nthe fun didn\u2019t stop there. at the end of the year my school had an awards ceremony in which people who won things/received scholarships and whatnot were recognized in front of the whole school. ronnie and i had to stand up in front of our whole school, medals shining on our chests, as the phrase \u201cplease give a round of applause to our special olympics gold medalists!\u201d was announced on the auditorium loudspeaker. our friends won\u2019t ever let us forget that one.\n\nso that\u2019s it really. we both kinda felt rough about it, and we have been volunteering/raising money for the special olympics ever since. i don\u2019t even like to say the word \u201cretarded\u201d. so hopefully we don\u2019t go right to hell, despite the fact that our record is now similar to that of eric cartman.\n\n \n\nedit: wowzers, did not expect this much attention for this. as long as this many people are seeing this, check out this link http://www.specialolympics.org/get_involved.aspx which will tell you how to volunteer near you. it's an amazing organization, though i won't promise that volunteering will get you a medal. by the way, thank you to the kind smartass who gilded this post\nSummary: sigh. the more i think about that medal the less i like it. \nQuestion: What is the reason you feel like you should not have",

every time i\u2019ve moved in the past, i\u2019ve hired a van and done it myself. this time, i decided to get removalists. it\u2019s summer here (australia), the humidity is insane, and i have accumulated a fair amount of stuff over the last year. i could have moved by myself, but i decided to \u201ctreat myself\u201d to some \u201cprofessional\u201d help. this is where the fu begins.\n\ni book an 8am pick up with a removalist company that had been recommended to me by a friend (by the end of this story you will understand why i want to murder this friend). i thought selecting an early morning pick up was a great idea, as i\u2019d be able to get all the hard work out of the way in the first half of the day, and then i could kick back and enjoy the rest of my australia day long weekend. so i pay my $200 deposit a few days before the move and get to work packing.\n\nwell\u2026 when the day to move comes along, it\u2019s 8:05 and i am completely packed and ready to rumble. i\u2019ve packed my kia rio with as much as it can physically hold. i\u2019m proud of myself for being so proactive, and i\u2019ve even managed to clean some of the rooms which will save time later. the clock\u2019s ticking\u2026 8:30 goes past with no word from the removalists\u2026 9am\u2026 9:30\u2026 then, finally, at 9:50 i get a call that they\u2019re 20 minutes away. *what\u2019s the point of booking an 8am pick up?* i think. but oh well, i decide to play real life tetris and attempt to jam my car with a few extra boxes while i wait.\n\nit\u2019s almost 10:30 when i finally hear the truck arrive. i head upstairs, and watch as the driver practically decimates the gumtree near my driveway as he backs the truck in. not a great start, but it wasn\u2019t my tree so i won\u2019t bring it up. he and another guy climb down out of the truck, and i am disappointed to see that they are skinny indians. i\u2019m half indian, and if i had wanted skeletal brown boys to help me move house, i would have asked my cousins and done it for free. and before you judge me, let me just say that one of the guys had biceps that were skinnier than my wrist. i\u2019m a 5\u20191\u201d girl. this whole set up isn\u2019t looking very promising.\n\nwe head downstairs into my apartment for them to check out all the stuff i have to move. the skinniest one takes one look at my sofa and immediately says he doesn\u2019t think we can get it upstairs. i asked if we could have a crack at least, because its not very big and i thought with a bit of manoeuvring we\u2019d be able to get it up the small stairway (it\u2019s like 12 steps max). he didn\u2019t look too keen on that idea, but said they\u2019d have a go. they took one look at my bed and said it definitely wouldn\u2019t fit out the door. so we\u2019re off to a great start, i\u2019m moving house today and will be spending my first night in the new apartment with no bed. instead of pushing the issue, i decide that i\u2019ll just have to come back tomorrow and figure out what to do with the bed. i know i'm an idiot, but that is just the beginning.\n\nwell, we start working on getting the smaller furniture and boxes upstairs. i\u2019m doing just as much, if not more, \u201cremoval\u201d as they are, but i figure that seeing as they charge by the hour, i may as well help and get it done quicker rather than have to pay more. as we\u2019re sweltering in the mid-morning sydney sun, they try to make conversation, and the skinniest one asks me where i\u2019m from. \u201caustralia,\u201d i say. he goes \u201cno, where are your parents from?\u201d i told him that my mum\u2019s from india, dad from england. he goes \u201cahh yes madam, i knew immediately right away that you were indian.\u201d *great*, i think. *now can you help me lift your end of the fridge?* the pleasantries of a polite conversation were lost on me in the 70% humidity and 30\u00b0c sydney sun.\n\nit seems like it took hours, and i am not kidding you when i say i hauled more than 50% of that stuff up there myself. but eventually, the sofa was the only thing left to go upstairs. they start pushing it towards the entrance, and everything\u2019s fine till they reach the bottom of the stairs outside my front door. it\u2019s a fairly narrow stairway, so understandably moving a large sofa is a pain, but it\u2019s definitely possible (i mean\u2026 i did get it in there myself). the skinny one drops his end of the sofa when he gets up to the 3rd step. he turns to me, probably seeing the slight pallor on my face, and says \u201cmadam, you should have told the head office that you had heavy items. this is not good.\u201d i felt bad, and instead of doing the intelligent thing and staying there to watch, i went into the kitchen to uselessly fumble about with a broom and sweep the lino. i had no idea what debasement was taking place. they dragged that couch up the stairs like a cowboy with his foot stuck in the stirrup of a bolting horse. needless to say, the couch i spent $600 on is well and truly wrecked. the upholstery on skinny boy\u2019s side was basically shredded as he dragged it up the cement steps all the way to the top. *s-so what?* i feebly tell myself. *the bit you sit on still works. that\u2019s all that you really need from a sofa\u2026right?* yeah. i wasn\u2019t convinced either.\n\nthe novelty of treating myself to removalists has well and truly worn off at this point. i see them begin shutting the truck doors, cringe as my lamp falls out, and sigh as i turn on my poor overloaded kia to drive to my new apartment. on the drive, i realise that i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever been more thankful for air conditioning in my whole life. i have that bitch turned up to level 3, and i am ignoring the feeling of my lips crack as my sweat dries on them. when i arrive at the new apartment and find a park, my boyfriend comes down to start unloading my car. i head out to the street to meet the two indian nightmares and show them where the elevator is.\n\nas we head inside, me loaded up with as much as i can possibly carry in attempt to shorten this ordeal, skinny boy sees my boyfriend and says \u201cahh yes, moving in with your brother, no?\u201d i am a small brown girl. my boyfriend is very tall, very white, and very red headed. this is confusing. if i looked so obviously indian earlier, how does this guy think we could possibly be related? the radiant heat had been oppressive, but surely it couldn\u2019t have affected him that badly. i sarcastically reply \u201cyep, the white ginger is definitely related to me.\u201d he is unimpressed, and launches into a tirade questioning my taste - why am i not going out with an indian? why don\u2019t i like indians? what\u2019s wrong with indian guys? this. this is what\u2019s wrong with them. \u201ci don\u2019t like indian guys because i don\u2019t find them attractive and they smell bad\u201d i reply. he laughs, and then tells me that if i was dating an indian, i wouldn\u2019t have to lift a finger and they\u2019d do all the hard work when we moved house. the irony on this is not lost on me, as i\u2019d just been hauling my own fridge upstairs with this idiot not even half an hour earlier. i\u2019m not sure if he thought insulting my boyfriend would make me suddenly want to date him, or if he thought i was experiencing heat exhaustion, or what. but it was a pretty awkward elevator ride after that.\n\nafter about 27 trips to and from the truck, everything was finally inside. aside from the sofa which was a lost cause, there are several dings on the wall, a shelf was dropped on my boyfriend\u2019s foot, and i really felt like i had to recharge with a solid nana nap. i needed these guys to leave. they won\u2019t leave without being paid. the guy wants to read my debit card details out over the phone to some guy supposedly in their head office, and luckily i did not have a strong enough bout of heat stroke to fall for that. they argued a bit in hindi (directly after finding out i can\u2019t speak it) and finally agreed i could do a bank transfer, so i sadly transferred the remaining $234 to them. $434 out of pocket for professional help + 1 shredded $600 sofa + irreversibly ruined pride. you do the maths - i\u2019m an idiot and i can\u2019t trust myself after this. but i deserved it.\n\ni don\u2019t think i have ever regretted spending money on a supposed \u201cluxury\u201d more than i do right now. oh yeah, and my bed that absolutely couldn\u2019t be moved by these two professionals? my younger sister picked it up with my mum, manoeuvred it up the stairs and chucked it in the back of her suv that afternoon. and i can\u2019t even complain, because they dropped it off and i had the best 8 hour sleep on it that night. unfortunately, as good as rem sleep is, i was not able to forget this entire incident once i woke up.\nSummary: 0\nText: i got the call from my cousin saying that

(haha). they couldn't quite comprehend it, and they left with their properly signed documents (we used a *normal* pen), while we were left cracking up in laughter.\n\nso yeah, they got their car, we got the money and we also got this absolutely stupid story that comes to mind every time we see one of these pens.\nlesson here: don't sign legal documents with these pens, as the message should be pretty obvious; stay in clear mind.\nSummary: oring. so my father had a legal document to fill out and sign. it needed a permanent pen, he borrowed mine, a frixon pen i",

i look around over the balcony, and then look inside my house.  goddamn, my windows are dirty.  i haven't noticed this before..  the tops of the windows look all smudged and hazy.  ....   .......   um\n\nso, i don't know if you've had the pleasure of walking into your home and seeing an uncontained fire nearly as tall as you are blazing in the corner..  but it takes your mind to a bunch of places, all at once.  it was almost like there was a really responsible person inside my head who just woke up out of a dead sleep and saw what was happening and started shouting \"emergency.  travis..  travis!  emergency!!!  dude, emergency!!\"\n\nthis was about the same time i learned that my smoke detector talks, too.  \"beep beep beep, fire! fire!, carbon monoxide detected!, fire! fire!, beep beep beep!\"\n\nholyshitfuckballs was my new mantra for the next minute or two as i grabbed a pan out of the cabinet and started running back and forth between my sink and the hallway and throwing water on the fire.  i knocked down the flames and opened my front door..  where i was met by, what i'm just going to call, \"the egyptian guy from downstair\" with an unbuttoned dress shirt and a towel wrapped around his waist.  he was obviously concerned with the amount of smoke pouring out from the top of my door.  i was nearly apoplectic at this point.  the fire was basically out, but all i could really muster for him was \"it's cool man.  everything's cool\" with my hands up like i'm about to be arrested.\n\n\"but, fire!\" he protested.\n\"no man, it's cool.  there's no fire.\"\n\"beep beep beep, fire! fire! fire!\" my smoke detector was yelling about how there was evidence to the contrary\n\"smoke!\" he pointed to my door again\n\nya, no shit man.  i left him and ran back inside.  the boxes were still smoldering and some embers were glowing around the edges.  i grabbed them and threw them in the shower, then went back to make sure there wasn't anything left burning.\n\ni attempt to pull my smoke alarm out of the wall.  it doesn't work.  i jam at a button who's function seems to be designed to silence the alarm for about five seconds, but only if you push it about 1,100 times.\n\ni accept that the alarm is just going to be a part of my life right now.\n\noutside, the egyptian man from downstairs has been joined by his wife.  i really don't know what he wants from me at this point.  another neighbor pokes his head out and now i feel obligated to make a public announcement about what i've almost done to all of our homes.  i step up to the railing and clear my throat and feel like i've just run a marathon where at the finish line you have to attend a press conference.\n\n\"everything's cool guys.  there was a thing..  um.  cardboard kinda caught on fire for a second.  i'm airing out the smoke.  the alarm should go off in a minute..\n\n.....i'm sorry everyone.  i'm sorry.\"\n\njust then, the alarm stopped and everyone seemed mostly satisfied, if not a little sketched.\n\nthank god for wood floors and smoke alarms.  i can't imagine what might have happened if i did that right before bed, or if i had left the house.\nSummary: ingrid and her husband were sitting on their porch having a cigarette when they smelled smoke.  ingrid ran inside to check it out. \nQuestion",

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: obligatory this didn't happen today, happened in summer 2017.  throwaway account b/c friends know my main and i would never live this down.\n\nsummer break 2017, i'm in my bed, 2 in the morning, about to have a wank, clean up, and go to bed.  tonight i'm feeling different, though, things were getting boring, and my horny, virgin brain decided that i needed a sex toy.\ni look up on youtube how to make one and see some video how you need a latex glove and lube and a bag or something.\ni start to look around the house, making as little noise as possible; i find a water bottle, two sponges, tissues and lotion as lube.  i thought i was a masturbatory genius or something as i shoved the sponges into the widest water bottle i could find, thinking about how much fun i was gonna have.  i put in a few layers of tissue, added lube and said it was good enough.  put on something from the hub and started slow.  the bottle was very tight, like too tight and i couldn't even go all the way in.  i decide to double down and go faster and harder.  bad idea.  i feel a slight burning, like brushburn, decide it's nothing too bad, keep going.  it's not working.  decide whatever, just a few more seconds and then give up.  worst idea of my year.  *fuck!* the worst pain i have ever felt erupted in my dick and felt like it spread to my whole body.  i immediately remove to see i have brushburned the entire side of the head of my dick and about half an inch of skin under the left side of the head.  also under the left side of the head there was an inch and a half tear on the circumference of my dick.  the lotion burned like no pain i have ever felt, and i immediately got dirty clothes from next to me and tried to absorb the lotion off like a sponge, because rubbing would only make it worse.  i stood up walked two steps and felt immense pain.  i was literally crippled from between my legs.  i was lost on what to do, for an hour, i lay sitting, thinking how i was going to explain to my father that i couldn't go to work tomorrow, how i was going to heal.  i go to the bathroom, look in the bottom drawer and an almost-empty bottle of prescription cortizone-10 i have from a problem with rashes i had as a little kid.  i applied on the worst areas and i prayed for the best.  i went to bed commando with elastic shorts on, woke up and my situation was 2x as good, but still bad enough that i could hardly walk.  i am very pressured to go to work because it's labor intensive and i was part of a 4-man crew, so missing work was taxing for the rest of the team.  i thought about a few solutions like tape, but came to the conclusion that i would have to fess up.  in retrospect, i could've thought of 10 million other better solutions to this, but i told my father (who's part of the work crew btw) that i couldn't go because i had a rash on my groin from doing push ups in the wrong shorts.  he obviously knew that wasn't the case, but all was good, and he went to work while i sat all day watching netflix and reapplying cortizone every few hours.  after that day the pain was just about completely gone.  but there was still a cut on my dick, and everytime i went at it, that cut opened.  scabbed over, cut open.  over and over.  this only stopped when my family and extended family went to a summer house for the last week of august and i restricted myself the whole time.  it healed over pretty well, a small mark, but i thought it was done.  wrong, it teared open the second time i went at it after i got home.  fast forward to 2 weeks ago, this scab still there.  went on a vacation for a week.  completely abstinent, an decided to abstain another week after vacation.  i am healed now, a light scar remains, and a lesson learned for life.\n\nthank you for reading my tale of terror.  if wanted, i can provide a picture of the famed cortizone bottle, as well as answer questions in the comments.\nSummary:  I was about  to masturbate, when i cut my penis. I could not work for over a month and was in great pain, until i"

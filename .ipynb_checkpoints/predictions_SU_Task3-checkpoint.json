They were crying, too. \"I know you were just scared, \" said the teacher. She gave them a hug.",

i do. we were standing by the atm and getting money. i put my hands by where the money would come out, the money hit my hands and went inside. an innocent mistake, i didn't mean no harm.  \nbut you spent hours telling me how me my friends and relatives will suffer, because we're not gonna go to mc d's. because i fucked up and i didn't think it trough. everyone was so eager to go there, but now they will be hungry and have to eat at home, because it was all my fault. and oh i do remember the phrase to this day \"now how they will think of you\".  \n\ni hate that phrase, try saying it to a kid near me, and i'm gonna whoop your ass.\n\nofcourse, everyone knew it was my fuckup. it was my fuckup and no birthday party for me nor anybody. bad kid. you are inferior.\n\nit was always like this, you do something that she doesn't like you are inferior. not \"undisciplined\", inferior. remember? oh do you rememer when i showed you that i predicted a result of a scientific study? i was fucking twelve. but nope, it didn't matter. it didn't matter because bobby got an a in math while i had a b.  \n\nremember, in 4th grade, i asked you to buy me a new school bag. because all others had non-kiddy ones. remember? you said we didn't have money, you said mine was fine and i should study harder. that i should look at daniel, who lives with a single mother and wears second-hand clothes. look how he loves her. look how good of a kid he is, not you ungrateful brat.  \ni remember, i went to a shop and bought a $3 bag, which i used for the next 3 years.\n\noh do you recall what happened when i didn't want to go to my grandpas birthday? \"grandpa loves you so much, and you don't love him. you will upset him and he will cry\".\n\nand the whole \"i am older and your mom. and you're a piece of shit\". crap, i remember coming to a friends house and being in trance from seeing that his mom talked to him like an equal. i was shocked, it hit me like a truck. why, what. i didn't understand why in the fuck would a parent talk to his kid like an equal. it felt good, but, so unnatural. it never really dawned on me.\n\ncrap, do you remember my clothing? i had to walk like i was living in the 70's at grandmas, because it was \"cool\" you've said. we weren't poor. our poor relatives managed to go on a vacation abroad. we were making twice as them. we lived in a shittier apt, we wore shittier clothes and eat worse food.  \n\noh remember how you berated me, that i help my aunt with the dishes while i don't do them at home. that i'm an asslicker and don't love you? i didn't know then, i thought that i was indeed a bad person. i remember how the aunts family was always cheerful and treated others better. aunt talked to me, she was interested in my life. but i didnt know why i helped her. i wanted to help her, i loved spending time at her place.  \n\nand you know, money. to this day i can perfectly recipe all the accents in the phrase \"we dont have money\". you and my stepdad made a shitton of money, but we never had enough. never had enough to let me go somewhere with my friends. or wait, do you think it was accidental that i started drinking at 15? $3 got you drunk and made life better for 6 hrs. or why i wasted so much time at the computer? yeah, because it was cheap. because we never had money for me to go somewhere. when i took my first job at 15 you made me pay 30% of my salary for my martial arts class. also for the flat/food and transport faire. i'm a bad ungrateful kid you said, i stopped doing sports. i was home at midnight. and because i was making money, no fucking allowance. because we had no moooooneeeeeeeeeeey.  \n\nironic, that you always had money to go and drink cofee with friends, you always had money to buy buns at the shop. that bag of cookies? yup. oh you always had money for another \"eastern meditation\" guy. you know, his kids were better than me. oh, and all those eastern bullshit courses you visited. yes ofcourse we had no money. it didn't matter that my pc was dying (i can ressurect pc's easily now). it didn't matter that it caused me great grief. we had no money, because we were poor. but that indian guy helped you improve your chakra.\n\noh remember how you liked to remember that i'm a burden on you, and without you i will die. because whatever energy coming from you will stop? yeah i do. remember how you liked to count my money?  oh i do. i asked stepdad for $20 he gave me $40. welp, one week without an allowance. cos fuck you.\n\nmoney money money. it was always about money. look how poor that grandma is. look at her and see how she counts the pennies. see how bad others have it. but we have it slightly less worse. remember?

(which im told tests facial nerves.) \n\nas you can imagine through the course of 30 eye examinations, some of the students are going to make mistakes, and some are going to really fuck up, although as 3rd years i wasn't expecting too much to go wrong. \nsome of the major mistakes included asking me to read text in a standard size 12 font from 5 meters away with one eye closed, which even saying it out loud should sound ridiculous! some students forgot to wash their hands and some forgot to check my name and date of birth.\nabout 20 tests in the next student comes in, a very nice, very polite and energetic girl and she starts the exam off very well. about 2 minutes in she is about to start the whole flash light in the eye section, so she picks up the supplied light and starts to press the top. it dosnt light up so she then tries twisting it; pushing it again, pressing the lens in, tapping it off the table and all sorts when there was a very obvious rubber button on the side of it. \nat this point i lost it. i burst out in uncontrollable hysterics laughing at this poor girls misfortune. i was laughing so hard i could hardly breath and i suppose laughter is infectious as the student then also burst out in laughter! we (or rather i) proceed to unintentionally waste the remainder of the 6 minutes she had to complete the exam by trying to hold a straight face, which i failed horribly to do.\nSummary:  the hospital exam i worked at was not going as expected. a student was having some trouble with a piece of equipment and the other students were having",

(i realize she's a girl, but i don't care who you are: if you hit me, i will hit you back. big or small, guy or girl ) then i take my seat back thinking it's over; nope. she picks up a glass and chucks it at me striking me in the face again. so what do i do? i got up and smack her across the face hard enough to send her into the next room and onto the ground (once again, open handed. i didn't punch her). this is followed by about 4 security guards tackling me, picking me up, and carrying me down three flights of stairs and out of the club.\n\nnow, i wouldn't say i was out to hurt this girl after she attacked me out of nowhere, however i wasn't going to back down either. she hit me once and i retaliated by hitting her once back each time. i could have gone after her and really hurt her, but that was more than necessary at the time. after i hit her the first time, i sat back down which is when she threw a glass at me and hit me in the side of the face. then i got up and hit her again, and after seeing her fall into the next room, i was immediately tackled by the security guards and whisked out. \n\ni would just like to know, how do you feel about hitting someone else? did i really react inappropriately or was i justified in my actions? i grew up with some messed up history and always told myself to never hit a girl because of witnessing domestic abuse first hand, but at the same time i was also raised to stand up for myself and defend myself the same if it was a guy or a girl. i don't take crap from anyone and i'm sorry, but if you're a girl and you hit me, expect to get hit back. there are no double standards as far as assault goes in my book. and by the way, i have a nice lump on my jaw from where the glass struck me. i'm not sure about her, but i'm pretty sure she has a good hand print on her face.\n\ni do realize that we were all a little drunk and there's the reality that i could have handled the situation differently, but i also realize that i reacted the same way i would have if i was sober. don't go attacking someone and expect them to just sit there and take it.\nSummary: ently, it seems that the speaker was involved in a scuffle in which the narrator was on the receiving end of a thrown glass. this caused the",

i chose to be an electricians mate and bootcamp was going by slowly, i wasn't craving drugs so much as i was just very bored with how slow everything moved. i had expected a lot more pt and a lot less sitting around everywhere we went listening to the next guy in the days schedule. towards the end of bootcamp we got into a lot of marching and unfortunately my voice would do this weird dinosaur shrieking sound after maybe 30 minutes as it started to kick the bucket for the day. i always felt bad for the poor souls who were around me in my division when the inner dilophosaurus in me would come out, it really was excruciating.\n\nenough about bootcamp though, i made it through and was now in my schooling to become an electricians mate. shit it's 8 hour classes all day mostly on the computer. i did my part for the first week, sat on the computer all day going through the motions. now the fuck up begins. on my 2nd week of schooling the instructor releases us for the lunch break and i am done with the day, fuck this shit. my mind wanders to a time i was smoking weed with 2 friends and they had talked about drinking cough syrup.. i've always been in great control when i did heavier drugs like acid or ecstasy, at least in enough control to play it cool. know where this is going? i got the brilliant idea to drink cough syrup on the lunch break and just buzz through the 2nd half of the day. at the store and with little knowledge on 'robotripping' i decide to pick the cough syrup delsym. they only had the small bottles and i'm 6'1 190lbs.. surely that wouldn't be enough for me. i purchased 2 of the small bottles of delsym and put them back like shots before returning to class.\n\nabout 30 minutes into class and i'm still not feeling anything except for a stomach ache, what a bust... then it hit me and oh my god did it hit me. the only way i can think to describe what happened next is by comparing my experience to the sims. i was looking down at myself as if i were a sims character. i felt like i was a hollow log with a strong breeze blowing through me. there was a girl sitting next to me who i had gotten to know the first week. i don't remember her name and i only knew her last but lets call her amy for the sake of the story. i think amy liked me and i consulted with her what i had done, i wasn't making it out of this by myself and i pleaded for help.\n\nin my early stages of this trip i remember amy being concerned, the next thing i knew class was over and she was helping me get outside for the march to the theater. i'm still looking down at myself walking at this point but with amy's help i make it into the marching group. i forget why we were going to the theater but everyone on base was going. as my unit was marching (it was 3 wide on sidewalk) the sidewalk hooked to the right. as the marching group went right i kept going forward mindlessly into the road with cars driving. amy was able to recover me quickly and     i think a few people were like wtf?\n\nfast forward to the theater and i'm in a seat, my vision has changed i'm looking out of my eyes now! i have a very strong tunnel vision and i'm still very much tripping but i'm in a better state now. i did it, i fucking made it i'll be able to sit an hour or two through this and i'll be good to march back. 30 minutes go by and i'm confident i'm going to make it through this when a petty officer approaches me and tells me to come with him. fuck why does he want me to go with him. as i stand up to follow my body is moving like i'm a fucking robot. i start following him high kneeing the shit out of every step. it's not that i thought i was marching, it's that i forgot how to use my body and that's the best i could come up with to move forward. i follow the petty officer to a white van and we get in. over the next 20 minutes or so i'm wondering where we are going.\n\nwe arrived at a hospital, okay i can play this off maybe they think i'm just sick. walking into the hospital we go to talk to a lady behind a counter and she asks what's wrong with me. i tell her i'm just not feeling well but i'll be fine. as i say that i drop my uniform jacket, i bend over to pick it up and lose balance and fall on my face. i was helped up and escorted to another counter where a lady had documents she told me to sign. i tried to read it but that wasn't happening so i attempted to sign it. i haven't struggled that much with a pen since i was in the 1st grade, and my signature reflected that. the next thing i know i'm in a bed and they are asking me to pee into a bottle. jokes on them, i read that dxm (the main ingredient in cough syrup) doesn't show up on a drug test and that was the only active ingredient in delsym. they knew though.. i don't know how it happened but they sent some psychological wizard my way and somehow she probed that i did all those drugs in high school and i was on cough syrup at the time / hated the schooling and how it was'so fucking boring'.\n\ni remember after that being escorted back to the van and being taken to a new building. i wasn't sure what it was and was still tripping. after that i remember being told to dress into a robe that opens in the back and put into a room with some plastic bed built into the ground, it looked like a rectangular block. there was a 2nd plastic bed block in the room with someone sleeping in it. \n\ni still wasn't sure where i was and laid on that block for what seemed like hours. finally my eyes opened and it was the following day. the person sleeping was now awake and standing by the door. it was an old guy, quite large with the back of his robe wide open for me to gander. next thing i know i'm sitting in a room full of that same plastic material with some 8 or 9 others. i'm sitting on my plastic chair looking around when it hits me.. i'm in a mental ward. god damnit! they kept me there for 2 or 3 days, had me speak to 5 or 6 people, i'm assuming a few of them were lawyers, i only talked to the one medical lady in a white jacket at the other end of the table. they came to the conclusion that i wasn't fit for the navy and my recruiter shouldn't have recruited me to begin with. flash forward a week and i'm talking to the main guy on the base (i don't remember his rank) and he oh so kindly put it that i was on my way out. the separation process took over a month and i was moved to a building where others were waiting to be separated. oddly enough we still had the privilege of leaving the base with the same curfews as the other e1,e2,e3's. during the separation process i was robo tripping 3 or 4 times a week at the chicago mall (only one small bottle this time) and became quite addicted to it. i was able to get 3 people to robo trip with me over the course of the separation and 2 of them did it quite often. by the end of it i received an entry level separation, they got me out in 5 1/2 months and the deadline for that separation was 6. it wasn't honorable but it wasn't dishonorable. i also received an re-4 on my dd214 so i checked the military off my future career list. the robo tripping went on to cause me another very major fuck up after i re entered the civilian life before i was finally able to get my shit together. all in all life is good now, i haven't touched drugs in 3 years and was able to put my addictive personality to use with running.\nSummary:  i took cough syrum and had a bad trip, went to mental hospital and dropped out the Navy. \n",

not all kids look like their parents.\n\nanyway, i kinda sat on it for a few hours, just going over the few scraps of paper in this folder, then finally decided to go find my sister. she had left at one point, but my mom was puttering around in the kitchen and saw me come in with the stack of photos and this folder. i figured it wouldn't hurt to ask her - we were family, and we loved each other. it didn't matter if i was adopted. she was my mother, the only one i knew and cared about, i loved her, and nothing would ever change that. \n\nso i showed her the folder, and asked if i was adopted.\n\nomg. she looked at the folder, and burst into tears. i reached out to give her a hug, and she just sat down and started talking about 'poor mikey'. i am not mikey, or michael, or mike. apparently she and dad had a son when they were first married named michael. when michael was 4 they went to a park miami, where they had been living. michael somehow got away from her and was hit by a car. she told me how she was so devastated, and my father was too, but he had insisted that they go and adopt a baby. she hadn't wanted to replace their son, *like a dog*, (her words) but he had been so insistent she had finally given in and i had been adopted out of alabama. she told me how it was so hard to learn to love me at first, but when my sister had been born almost a year after my adoption she felt like she could be a mother again and accept me. \n\ni... was stunned. i asked her if she had taken her medication, because i couldn't believe what she was saying. i had been adopted as a baby, but she was insinuating there was almost a year when i was like the annoying house cat my father insisted on and she put up with because she loved him. she told me i could never replace mikey, but i 'came into my own' as i got older 'like a real son'. she sat sobbing at the kitchen island for a good half hour while i puttered around the rest of the house, packing up dads stuff. my sister came back and immediately asked me why mom was all haggard and weepy in the kitchen. i gave her a basic run down, but she didn't believe me and went to talk to mom herself. hour later, she's all weepy, helping me pack up stuff. she asked if i was ok. i said yeah and left. \n\ndidn't talk to my mother for a few days. my sister called me to ask about our arrangement - where i would move into moms house and she could get back to her own family. i had been staying in a hotel since the incident. i told her i didn't know, and she seemed shocked that finding out i was adopted would make me turn on mom. i tried explaining that no, it wasn't the adoption, it was the weird 'you weren't really my son' vibe i was suddenly getting. was i over reacting? maybe. so i worked up the nerve to call mom and ask if i could come over. she seemed surprised i felt the need to ask. i went over and she had a little lunch ready for us. we sat down... and she proceeded to tell me what a weight i had taken off her chest. she was all smiles telling me how now that i was older and it was all out in the open, we could start over and get to know each other as friends. \n\nwhat? what?!?!? who the hell is this woman?! \n\ni couldn't afford my own place at the time so i did move in with her, but it was beyond weird. really too much to go into, but imagine all those motherly touches you expect at your mom's house are suddenly gone. she really went from a mom to a roommate trying to be my best friend in a weird creepy way almost overnight. she quietly insisted i call her by her first name. first time my sister heard it she flipped her shit - until mom told her that she had asked me to do it.\n\nmy sister eventually witnessed enough weirdness she said she wanted to talk to mom about it. this was almost a year out for me, so i begged her to wait a few more months but didn't tell her that i had almost saved up enough for a down payment on a little house across town. i was just suddenly feeling so unwelcome, it was almost like mom had died. when she finally did ask mom why she was acting this way towards me mom tried to placate her and tell her that it was alright, that i was a grownup and was comfortable with our arrangement. i'm ashamed to say it felt really good to say no, it wasn't ok, and tell her i was moving out. right there. she looked all confused and asked why, and i just left. i came back over the next week to get my things, and she cried each time and told me if i left she would loose the house. i was really torn until she told me she wouldn't be able to find another roommate before the mortgage was due. \n\nmom lost the house, but i made it clear she couldn't live with me and my sister said the same. she moved into a crappy little singles apartment, and i want to feel bad but i can't. she stopped talking to me all together but my sister says she tries to call her all the time, and has told her husband that i was an ass and ruined the relationship between her and her daughter. i'm still pretty upset but really have only myself to blame for asking her about the folder. \n\n \n\nedit: thanks a lot you guys. you're really some warm people. i really do feel a lot better that there are people who get the whole mom gestures thing. it's so hard to describe to people without feeling like i was demanding to be treated like a little kid again and that wasn't what i meant. you guys are awesome. \n\nedit 2: thank you again you guys, so very very much. i'm off to work and wanted to let you guys know i had meant to post this as a 'crazy, right?

remember how i said i had no functional strength? i'd never done a standing press in my life, or lifted anything like that over my head, especially while drunk as hell.\n\ni dropped this girl flat on her ass from a good 1.8 metres high onto concrete. the slap she made when she hit the floor sounded to me like what thunder sounds like to an astraphobic. it was horrific. you know that moment where you sober up instantly. regardless of how wasted you are, all your senses suddenly spring to life again, and you realise you've done something horrific.\n\nas i'm stood there in shock, her friends come over to assess her. she was mildly concussed. i looked over at my buddies, and indeed around the bar, where everyone was stood mouth open. i felt horrific. like the weight of a thousand wrong-doings had just crashed upon me like grace had crashed upon the floor.\n\ni ran out the bar and sobbed my way home out of pure pure embarrassment. \n\nanyway i managed to get an apology in, but i never really associated with her again after that.\n\nthe moral of the story is - if you're going to lift weights, lift them properly! and don't ever try and impress a girl when your drunk, but thats a given i'm sure.\n\n \nsocial retard with girls, isolation exercises only in the gym, put imbalanced muscles to work for the first time by lifting a girl up in a bar, drop her flat on her ass\nSummary: 8.4 I am the moron, we are the narrator. \"We are now going into the life and the lift of my weight. \n",

would any of my friends get to adopt them? what would they look like?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\ni ran out into the living room and grabbed my mother, excitedly dragging her back into the room. heart racing and girly hormones a'tremble, i looked at the five little hamster babies, joy spilling out of my uterus. but then...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n...my heart dropped into the pit of my stomach, falling straight out my butt and onto the floor. what happened was indescribably horrific; that hoebag hamster, pupu, changed my entire concept of life as i knew it, and her actions would forever alter the way i thought about owning a pet any less intelligent than a house cat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\npupu reached over, and without any hesitation, stuffed one of her babies into her mouth. my eyes widened. she bit it right in half, snacking on the hamster's face as unenthusiastically as a fat guy on a couch eats a bag of cheetos, watchin'  the game.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nbefore i burst out into a fit of uncontrollable sobs that would last for minutes, pupu managed to eat several of her babies while pipi chilled in the top corner of the cage, probably thinking something like, 'dumb ho said she was on the pill!'\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nturns out, hamsters eating their young is a really common occurrence. when it happens to a teenage girl's married hamster couple, it's a little more dramatic than it sounds. but that's the truth of it. the mother hamster will eat them either due to shock and fear, or having a lack of resources in her body. apparently, pupu was freakin' anemic or some shit, because none of her litter survived.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nafter that, i was absolutely scarred. i caught pipi, once again, trying to mate with pupu, likely thinking something like, 'hey, she dumb, but she hawt!' i couldn't take it. so i gave pupu away and kept my rapist teddy bear hamster, the father to five deceased children, cannibalized by their own mother, ultimately, pipi's now ex-wife.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nthe good news is that pipi lived out a normal, healthy life. he died of old age. and i will never, ever, ever have a hamster again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nedit: front page?! so excite! much happy! wow! :d\nthank you redditors for all the support. i really appreciate all the lovely comments about your lulz, and my writing style. really, like, you have no idea how...how much i...oh god it's happening again ~joy seething from uterus~\n\n&nbsp;\n\nps. i was a dumb 16 year old at the time (redundant statement.) i am much more pet savvy now and believe research should be done before getting a pet. i also have a kitty who was abused by her former owner, and now she is happy. and no hamsters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nedit 2: thanks, everyone, for telling me your stories too! there were so many replies i couldn't respond to most of them. but i did go through and read everyone else's traumatic experiences. it seems everyone, including myself, thought we just had some crazy experience which actually turned out to be super common! nature is daaark, man.  i also appreciate the advice, like getting a bigger cage, or putting some meat next to the mother when she has her babies. ultimately, i learned that hamsters are solitary, and that a lot of people (like some derpy 16 year old girls) just don't know the best way to house them in order to prevent this stuff from happening.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nso, thanks again! i love having friends, so if you see me on teh subredditz, wave!\nSummary: es, please, hi! :) i, \nQuestion: I am writing a blog post on hamsterters. &nbsp;\nQuestion  How",

(i did get a whole van row to myself though.)\n\nwhen we finally got back, i got the dad of one of the kids on the trip (who happened to be a doctor) to take a look at me to see what he thought about them, and he said that i should be fine as long as we kept them bandaged up. \n\nnormally, this would be the end of a story like this, but we had a vacation planned that happened directly after the trip to destin, florida. the doctor dad from earlier said that near the end of the trip it would probably be ok for me to go in. \n\nhe would have been right if it weren't for one small detail. a detail that we didn't know about until the day we left for home. \n\nthere was flesh eating bacteria in the water. \n\nthat had already killed 4 people. \n\nin the same part of the beach i had gone in. \n\nnow as you can tell by reading this post, i am still alive. the bacteria did not infect me, and all that is left are two black scars on my knees. \n\nhere's some pics of the wounds (warning:very gross):\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/etus3a6pp/e3093_a5_f_63_db_472_f_a7_aa_c98_b705_db724.jpg\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/phyj24got/3_ad076_d3_be3_c_4801_b765_f967_c6_f18506.jpg\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/rnxfad9j1/dd6_c4_f6_b_6_ea1_407_c_9_ba5_9_de81_baf5_f53.jpg\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/lbia0j6gt/eb396945_52_e2_4923_a0_b5_6_fe6_b25_b12_b6.jpg\nhttps://s28.postimg.org/ygxs6n0cd/91_af6_f5_b_3890_4027_9_aca_afc177_efc97_a.jpg\n\nhere is what the scars look like now:\nhttps://s7.postimg.org/662vas1mj/img_4704.jpg\nhttps://s7.postimg.org/v0md4umgr/img_4705.jpg\n\n \n\nedit: fixed a typo\nSummary:  The narrator and his friends went on an ill planned bike trip where they got hurt. \n",

(fuck me, right?) this then allowed the possibility of accidentally sleeping in before my shift. which of course happened. i was a full hour late getting there. i apologized profusely, did my best work without using the box crusher, put in an extra hour of paid work, then volunteered on my own time right up until the stored closed to make sure everything was perfect, and i made sure my manager knew it. \n\nsunday rolls around. the day they post the schedules. i go in to check it, and i'm not on the schedule at all. my row of hours is completely just missing. he's really busy and a bit scattered so he's bound to make a mistake at some point right? so i go and talk to my manager about it. \"oh yeah i just made that in two minutes, when do you work next? thursday? i'll talk to you about it then.\" it? something he can't talk about now? sounds suspicious, but ok. thursday rolls around. yup, that's today. keep in mind that it's already too late to change next weeks schedule because it's only 2 days until the schedule for the week after is due. so i work, do my best and all that, but my manager says nothing about it and is acting kinda weird around me. so i mention it to him. \"oh ya, sorry [blah blah blah, i forget what he said because the way he said it made me super stressed that something was gonna happen] why don't you come in for three hours on saturday? any time between 8:00am and 4:30pm. as long as i'm here. you know what? just come in at 12:00 for 3 hours.\" \n\nthis is where i'm at. i don't think my girlfriends mom ratted me out, but is possible due to the fact that she super serious about being in control of 4 cashiers. and i'm pretty sure that i made up for sleeping in, i mean it's the second time i've ever been late! but on saturday my manager for sure doesn't need any extra help, let alone help for only 3 hours. looks to me like i'm gonna get fired. which normally wouldn't be *that* big of a deal, but this store is the only job i can get within reasonable distance of my house and i need work experience, a good reference, and a car to get to my next job up. i'm pretty fucked as far as i can see. why else would i go in for 3 hours?\n\n \n\nupdate: i got fired. fuck. but it was nothing that i had expected. the employees bathroom is a shit stained mess plastered in graffiti. some recent \"art\" contained a ton of swearing in it. half sarcastically i wrote below it \"watch the language please\" and my employer found that it matched my other printing. i straight up told the truth about it and he didn't care to give any second chances.\n\nso basically i got fired for asking my coworkers not to swear\nSummary: ing to work at this grocery i have to go to a grocery in a town 20 minutes away to do a job that pays better, has more",

good effect!\n\n\nhowever, my moment of \"victory\" was abruptly cut short by the sound of brakes locking up and tires squealing to a sudden halt. **\"errrrrrrrrkkkk!\"** it was like somebody pulled the needle off the record and everything snapped back to reality. oh shit....the car stopped! beth and i get small, crouch down out of sight and wait for the car to drive off, like the others that stopped before. not this one. \n\noh shit.....is that a car door? yes, that's a car door slamming shut. this is not good. we crouch down even more and did our best to stay still and absolutely quiet, keeping our ears open and listening for anything other than the idling car engine and the occasional wind through the trees. a voice in the distance broke the silence. a man.....probably in his 40s, i would guess. the exact words he used escape me now, but put it this way - he knew what had happened and he was rather pissed off. bits of the monologue included *\"what the fuck\", \"who do you think you are?\", \"i know you're down there\".* i swear, with the amount of rage that this guy was letting off, you'd think he'd had the worst day ever. maybe he did and my well placed snowball was the icing on the cake that sent him over the edge. who knows. all i know, is that this guy was blowing a gasket and the situation was looking bleaker by the second.\n\n\nbeth and i stay quiet, hoping that he'll abandon his search and return to his car. our hearts were racing and the tension in the air was so thick, you'd probably need a jackhammer to break through it. the voice is getting closer. shit........we had no exit strategy. stupid, stupid, stupid! we start backpedaling slowly, putting ourselves into position to escape if we had to. then.....as if on cue, we were greeted by the sounds of rustling brush and snapping tree limbs fairly close by. \n\n\nmotherfucker..........\n\n\nwe have contact.\n\n\n*oh fuck! oh fuck! oh fuck! oh fuck!* these are the thoughts running through my head as i realize that this guy is now crashing through the treeline towards our position, hollering and hellbent on revenge. well kids, this ends the stealth portion of our mission. beth grabs me and we take off into a sprint, running for our lives and dodging trees like luke on a speeder bike in the forest of the endor moon. this motherfucker is chasing us! where are the ewoks when we need them? those furry little bastards can show up at any time now! \n\n\nadrenaline is coursing through my veins and i'm looking back as we're hauling ass out of dodge, trying to get a glimpse of our pursuer. beth gracefully clears a low lying tree branch in our path. i try to follow suit and like a typical horror movie cliche, i trip over it, bust my knee and go tumbling ass over teakettle. what perfect timing. did i mention there's an enraged lunatic chasing us? yup, here i am, struggling to get up, while some asshole with presumably-bad-intentions - is gaining on me. this is turning into a shitshow real quick.\n\n\nthe pain in my knee subsides just enough to where i can muster up the strength to get back on my feet. i end up hobbling and hopping until i'm fully mobile again, then i break into a run. the hollering of expletives and rage become more distant as i dash the rest of the way through the trails back to my house. huffing and puffing, me and beth are just standing there, looking at each other with a \"wtf just happened?\" look. no more sounds of hollering and rustling in the trees. either the lunatic gave up and let us run, or we lost him. to be safe, we got the fuck in the house and stayed there, in case he came driving through, looking for us.\n\n\nbeth and i still laugh about that story to this day. but that was the last time i ever threw a snowball at a car in mischief.\n\n\n \n\nedit: it was endor moon - not dagobah - in which the speeder chase i referenced, had occurred. brain fart.\nSummary:.

so over the course of an hour, we load up on drinks and food, ranging from chocolate to weird foreign candy that none of us had ever heard of. when we finally finish our spree, we've spent more on candy then we did on marijuana, and it is now past our driving curfew. i suppose now is a good time to mention that i am 17, friend 1 one is 17, and friend 2 is 16, all of us have or license but we are in a single car.\n\n\nthen, we fucked up.\n\n\nbad.\n\n\ninstead of deciding to go to a basement of one of our houses, we figure that we might as well go to the small dirt pit, **next to a public library**. you couldn't see the pit from the road, as it was about 10 meters below street level, however this also means that **we** couldn't see the road or any cars coming on it; essentially we were blind to seeing any incoming cars until it was too late. anyways, we pull into the pit, and hide the car against the wall in case we needed to make a *\"get-away\"*. what a joke.\n\n\nbeing amateurs, we had decided that using metal pens would be the best way to smoke the pot, and we bought some from the local store. now, if you can imagine three guys, crammed into a car, dissembling a pen, and trying to stick a clump of weed in, you have a pretty good idea of what we looked like. eventually, we get everything in place, and friend 1 decides to take the first hit. as he begins to light it, i took a closer look at the bottom of the pen, **it was fucking plastic**. instead of smoking the drug, we were instead about to inhale toxic plastic fumes thinking that we could get high. i point this out, and a collective moment of stupidity envelops the car. after trying various other designs, i manage to macgyver an empty bottle of monster into a functioning pipe. cut a small hole near the bottom of the can, break the plastic off the pen, stick it into the hole, put the marijuana in the can, screw the lid on, warm the bottom, and suck through the hollow plastic. to be fair, in that moment i was pretty proud of myself.\n\n\nso finally, we start to get it going, we can taste a little bit of it. so we're passing this can around, tasting this foreign smoke, and just as it starts to smoke--\n\n\n--the unmistakable headlights of a police-issued chevy camaro turn into the pit.\n\n\n**fuck.**\n\n\ni point this out to both of my friends, instantaneously i knew how badly we had just screwed up, i'm sure they did too. when your first encounter with a cop entails the possession and usage of an illegal drug, you want to run like hell, you want to never come back, but i am so glad none of us chose to do that.\n\n\nthe car comes to a slow stop in front of us, no light-bar on but just bright-ass headlights. gradually, the officer walks over to our car, mag light in hand. the first words out of his mouth,\n\n\n\"alright, where's the dope?\"\n\n\nfriend 2, who was in the driver's seat says that he doesn't know what the officer was talking about, but that didn't last long. the smell was pungent, we knew it and the officer knew it, he made it very clear,\n\n\n\"i can smell it, where is it?\"\n\n\nf2 gave up, he reached over f1 (who was in the passenger seat), retrieved the small bag and handed it to the officer standing outside. by this point, a second officer (officer 2, or o2 if you will) had arrived and made his way over to the car.\n\n\no1: \"so what were you guys using to smoke this?\"\n\n\nfriend 2 holds up the can of monster, and i shit you not, **officer 2 starts laughing**. i mean shit, i could even see officer 1 smirking.\n\n\no2 (still chuckling): \"you guys are new to this aren't you?\"\n\n\nin some way, shape or form we all responded yes. up until this point, i was almost sure we were getting arrested, so i had refrained from saying anything. but now, it was almost like a lighter mood had come in. we're all profusely apologizing, commenting on how stupid we were, then officer two notices the bags of food in the back seat next to me.\n\n\no2: \"you guys watch dumb and dumber too much and think you were going to get the munchies? you're supposed to get the food after you're high.\"\n\n\nhe's literally laughing his ass off at this point, maybe because we were novices, maybe because it was the start of his shift, but he was laughing. the chat between us and the officers would be too long to type, but it was was as light and funny as a conversation between two friends. officer 1 runs all of our licenses, and returns to the car.\n\n\n\"you guys are good kids, you really screwed up, not only do you have illegal drugs in the car, but you're breaking curfew and *his* curfew for simply being out in the town is about to be up.\"\n\n\nhe pointed to friend 2, in our town if you are 16 you must be home by midnight, you can't even be walking around.\n\n\nanyways, he tells friend 2 to call his parents to come pick us up, since we were all sleeping at his house and couldn't drive ourselves home. both of them tell us that they won't tell friend 2's parents that we had marijuana in the car, but that we were just out past curfew, he even suggests that we spray the car down with cologne if we have any to try and mask the smell. officer 2, who had been standing tells us that we can put all of our food and bags into the trunk. well, at this point, about 12 bottles of gatorade that we had bought from the gas station were out of sight on the floor. so as i begin to hand what seems like an endless stream of gatorade to friend 2, both of the officer start laughing again.\n\n\nwhat could we do, they were on sale for $3/2.\n\n\nanyways, friend 2's dad finally arrives, not exactly in the best mood but we couldn't care, we weren't getting arrested and none of our parents knew that we just dodged the charge of drug possession. the night that followed included us sneaking out to laden the car with aerosol fresheners and hand-held vacuums.\n\n\ni don't thinking i'm going to try marijuana again for quite some time.\n\n\n \n\n\ni'm sure they're sitting at the station now, telling everybody how they caught kids trying to smoke weed out of a monster can with a pen.\nSummary: ingram.com\n",

 i had momentary visions of my everlasting fame in medical textbooks.\n\ndiscovering that old quasimodo had developed a hunchback was rather shocking, as nothing like this had ever happened down there before, nor did i have any reason to expect that it would, being a happily and faithfully married man.  i opted to try to make it through the workday.  meanwhile, quasimodo was sending me ever more frequent reminders that there was \"trouble on the border.\"  i was also getting dizzy and generally feeling absolutely crappy, so in the mid-afternoon i left early and went to the urgent care across the street.  these folks have always done a good job when i have visited them before, so i was sure they'd be able to help.\n\ni walked through the door.  the receptionist greeted me and asked \"what brings you here today?\"  i was about to answer when i noticed the tv news crew!  nope, not kidding.  i managed to come in just as a news crew was filming a segment for the 10 o clock news about the urgent care facility and the sudden uprise in respiratory illnesses after the thanksgiving holiday.  i could faintly hear the laws of probability laughing hysterically at me.\n\ntaking no chances, i told the receptionist i was there for a cough, and other reasons that i'd explain later.  in the back room.  when there wasn't a tv camera pointed in our general direction.  not too long afterwards, i was in an exam room, speaking to a nice nurse about both my persistent cough, and quasimodo's predicament.\n\n\"let's deal with the cough first\" she said.  i had no objections.  turns out i had a sinus and ear infection.  that would explain the dizziness and general craptastic feeling of exhaustion all day.  she said she'd prescribe antibiotics, then said \"now, let's check out the other problem.\"\n \nfeeling somewhat awkward, i stalled for time.  \"so, i should just... uh...\"\n \n\"yep.\" she said.\n\ni dropped my trousers, and the nurse took a look.  then she grabbed quasimodo and positioned him for proper viewing of the afflicted area.  the infection was nastier and more horrifying than ever.  \"wow, that's pretty big.\" she said.  being a well-bred and respectful man, as well as being pretty much totally at her mercy, i declined to make the obvious comment here.  besides, we both knew she was talking about the lump.\n\n\"hold that thought, i'm going to get the doctor,\" she said, and whisked out of the room.  i stood there for a moment, thinking \"wow.  the nurse just called for backup!  that can't be good, can it?\" \n\na few minutes later, the doctor arrived.  he said \"what do we have here, an ingrown hair?  let's have a look.\"  i felt relieved.  \"it's not that bad,\" i told myself, \"he'll just tell me the antibiotics should take care of it, maybe at the worst, poke it with a needle.\"  the doc took a look.  \"you've got a cyst,\" he said to me.  \"get me a number 11 scalpel.\" he said to the nurse.\n\nthen he said some other things, but i don't know what they were because i all could hear was the word \"scalpel...scalpel...scalpel\" going through my head.  i asked him to repeat everything after \"scalpel.\"  he informed me that the cyst was infected and would need to be drained.  he would need to make a small incision.\n\nnow, at this point, quasimodo began to get very nervous.  seinfeld fans are doubtless familiar with the concept of \"shrinkage.\"  well, there was significant shrinkage at this point.  then the doctor said \"now, we could use a local anesthetic, but i'll be honest, it's going to hurt either way \u2013 the anesthetic will probably hurt longer than the actual incision will.\"\n\ni smiled confidently (at least i told myself it was a confident smile \u2013 i noticed my voice had gone up an octave, though), and said \"you're the doc, you know best.\"  i thought to myself, \"did i just agree to have my manhood sliced into without benefit of painkillers?\"  the doctor was saying something again, but i didn't really hear any of it.  \"shrinkage\" no longer seemed an adequate word.  quasimodo was now attempting to retreat completely from view, and my eyes were fixed upon the gleaming blade being carried by the nurse as she re-entered the room.\n\nnow, a number 11 scalpel is not very big.  i know this, from a rational point of view.  however, as it approached old quasimodo, it looked like it ought to be on the bottom of a lawn mower deck somewhere.  my brain dealt with this threat quickly and decisively.  it dumped my entire reserves of adrenaline into my bloodstream, and sent a series of urgent survival commands to my body.  these commands were as follows:  \"ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun, you fool!\"\n\nalas, i could not run.  the nurse had regained her grip on quasimodo, and i was bared to the blade.  i reflected with a sense of poignant longing on my awakening earlier that day, when the worst problem i had was exhaustion and a terrible cough.  it was a happier, more innocent time when the idea of a knife-wielding maniac going after my privates was not even on my radar.\n\nthe doctor said \"this is going to hurt, but you can stand it for two seconds.  that's all i will need, just two seconds. try not to move.\"  i should mention at this point, that i had regained a shaky sense of calm by telling myself \"he's just going to make a quick cut across the surface of the skin.  just a scratch, really.\"  i was just finishing telling myself that, when he drove the point of the scalpel directly down into the cyst!  i had been skewered!  helpfully, he began counting the two seconds for me.  i remember distinctly\u2014he said\n\n\"oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee....... thoooooooouuuuuuuuussssssaaaaaaaanddddddddd oooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\u2026\u2026ooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeee thooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuussssssaaaaaaaannnnnnddddddddddd twoooooooooooooooooooooooo.... doooooooooooooooooooone.\"\n\nwhile the longest two seconds in my life were counted out, i was very busy.  one part of my brain was still shrieking \"ruuuuuuuun!\" while another part was yelling \"don't move, you fool!\" and the rest of it was just mumbling \"knife in my penis! knife in my penis! knife in my penis!\" over and over.  the \"don't move\" portion of my brain won out, because when a man with a knife at your junk tells you not to move, you bloody well don't move!  the blade went a lot deeper than i had expected it to, and then the doctor sliced down \u2013 just a fraction of an inch\u2014and wiggled the blade just a tiny bit. \n\nto put it succinctly, it was a sensation not unlike pain.  \n\ni will spare you a description of the aftermath, as it was gory and disgusting and not at all funny.  when it was over, the doc informed me i should come back on friday, since if the cyst didn't drain out completely, we'd have to do a local anesthetic and \"cut it out and stitch it up.\"  i gather that this will be a more involved, and presumably more painful process, since we tried to avoid it the first time.  i can hardly wait for friday.\n\nfinal note:  apparently these cysts \"just happen.\" \u2013 mine had probably been lurking in an uninfected form for a while, and only got noticed once infection started.  they aren't dangerous, but once infected they need to get dealt with.  the doctor and staff at the urgent care were great, and the procedure really was less painful than i thought it would be \u2013 but then, i do have a very vivid imagination.  i'd try to score macho points for having it done without anesthetic, but quasimodo is living in fear of friday and totally ruining my machismo.\nSummary: 1) a doctor would have known best.2) an incisioon would not have hurt like that.3) the situation would never have",

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: i didnt fuck up today, this is about a years worth of fuckups leading to the ultimate fuckup, losing the one you love.\n\nso to start off with some context, about 2 years ago i met this girl on steam. now it was a completely random meeting she ended up adding me off some guy's friend list. this was some guy i had met before and we weren't really close he was just an ok fellow to play with.\nso this girl (ill call her rachel or r from now on) added me and asked me about a game series out of the blue. it was a funny way to start a conversation but we did have a good conversation about it, went on for hours. \n\ni was hoping because i didnt have many good friends at the time that she would sprout into one of those. now keep in mind, i have no idea the extent of what shes been through or that anything is going wrong for her at this time.\n\nso the next couple days all she does is send me invites for a game which i thought was an odd way to be a friend no conversation. so i ignored them for a while hoping that maybe she would talk to me further at some point, but i wasnt hopeful for much. actually i had planned on removing her like a week or two after we met because it wasnt promising. \n\nafter much of these invites, i decide to finally join up on one. im in the game and of course its her friends in the game and they sorta gang up on me because i suck but whatever i ride it out because maybe joining this will get her to talk to me. \n\nits now been roughly a month and ive joined a few of her games but still we haven't talked much other than one line responses primarily me joking about her invites. \n\na little bit further down the line from that, she brings something semi-serious up (im sorry its been a long time i cant really remember) that strikes my interest. so naturally trying to be good, i talk to her about it and offer my experience in wanting to be different as well. (i was a trolling asshole at this point and i wanted real friends basically) \nthis conversation happened and we became a little bit closer, eventually getting to the point of actually talking about school, games, etc. basic things. \n\nwe then progressed further often playing games and whatnot talking on skype having a good time. this is going well and i think ive found myself a good new friend. \n\none night im playing a game with my friend and its like 2am my time so im a bit tired and getting ready to sleep soon. all of a sudden i was having a conversation with r about things in her past she had an ex that apparently things did not go well at all with. we're talking in text chat while i play with my friend and she seems very upset about the whole situation rightfully so. \n\ni try to comfort her, tell her that shes not wrong for thinking this way in a summed up sense, that things did suck and listened to her full story. the guy she was talking about is crucial to this, so ill call him k or kraig. at this point, k seems like the worst person ever to me because he treated her like garbage, refused to respond to her, and ignored her cries for help. getting into that: this is pretty much when she opened up to me a bit about issues shes struggled with, depression, relationship issues, warped definitions of affection, many \nthings she should not have had to struggle with.\n\nso now i know all this and it begins to make sense to me why she just sent me invites and didnt talk to me, she has overwhelming anxiety and other things that are horrible to deal with. i ended up talking to her on skype and telling my friend brb in voice while i went to talk to her. she was crying and she seemed the most upset shes ever let me hear her, and i felt horrible. \n\nthe toll that what shes been through had taken on her crushed me it sucked to see someone feel that low. so this night has happened and she seemed a lot better at the end of it and she thanked me for talking to her i got her to cheer up i know that. this event has brought us closer and now we talk a lot more about personal things like what shes dealt with and more serious things. \n\nwe've become really close as friends and she brings up this k guy semi-often and i sorta just told her forget about him he sucks because he did in my mind. \n\nnow this is whats crazy is not to get into details but i had something happen to me that seemed like a slight pain that wasnt a big deal to me so i mostly ignored it. however, she convinced me to do something about it and go to the emergency room and i know it sounds stupid but i really wasnt going to do it before she insisted i do. turns out, that could've killed me if i had let it go so in a way she saved my life. \n\nroughly a month in the hospital and im out, and shes there still being a great friend to me.\n\nby this point i really like her shes become a very important person to me, and ive got a little crush on her.\nthings go on we're still having fun enjoying time together when my first major screwup happens. there was a night we were talking and stupidly i bugged her to put k in the skype call. \n\nwhy did i do this, well because k really bothered me i hated him for what he did to her and all i wanted to do was cuss him out and insult him, things of that nature. now from her point it looks like i just wanted to start drama between them and watch, which wouldve been a poor move on my part. i fought for my side and she wasnt having it so i ended up making her remove me because i was being pushy about it. \nso a few months go by and i decided to add her back to fix this situation because i really loved being around her she was amazing. a few months after this happened there was this guy she liked and was gonna tell him her feelings. i convinced her go for it do it, i hope things work out for you. \n\nthe guy ended up rejecting her not wanting that relationship with her and she was kinda bummed but i told her to keep her head up. about 10 minutes later i dropped a serious bomb on her and asked her out, she was stunned and told me she'd love to be my girlfriend but she needed time to think things over about k and prior things. \n\nso i gave her the time, a few days later she agreed to it. things are going good with r i love her and she says she loves me we're doing it all well. about 4 or 5 months in, second screwup happens where its revealed that i lied about something since we started dating. \ncompletely wrong on my part, i screwed up bad there and i felt terrible for it but the circumstances made it hard to come clean. we make up from that, things are decent again and its going smooth.\n\nshe tells me she wants to really deal with k again which is fine because i feel shes loyal to me and she needs to do what she needs to do.\nabout a month or two later, im feeling very distant to her and it seems like she doesnt want to do as much with me. maybe im being overly attached but she seems different, shes obviously upset about something i know her. i asked her a few times albeit lightly if she had anything wrong, if she was doing ok to which she replied yes all was well. but i knew this wasnt the same girl i had been with, things had changed. \n\ni asked her again whats the deal, is something changed whats wrong. this time she told me what the issue was straight up. this is speedbump #3 (keep in mind im sorta thinking that maybe screwup #2 was what did this to us) where she says she never had a crush on me when i asked her out and she didnt feel that way about me. so that kinda sucked... and she said the reason she'd been so distant was because shes been trying to deal with k. \n\ni tell her i get it and she says she grew feelings for me being in that relationship and she wants to sit somewhere between dating and friendship. i tell her i understand and we do that. she talked to me a lot the next week or so about k and how she messed up with him and she wants to make things right. i supported her with this but i still think that k is terrible on the inside and he wronged r. \n\na couple days pass and screwup #4 happens which is where i decide on my own will (she pretty much was saying dont do this) to add k and see if he had gotten some very important messages r sent him. now, r's main problem with k and why shes so hurt is because k never listened to her and she finally thinks that k did listen to her messages.\ni dont think he did and as such adding him i ask if he ever got them. i had done this because i was sick of k wasting r's time with this and i felt in my own mind it was best to have r move on. he says no and i tell r, where did i fuck up, well she didnt want to know that and i should have asked her if she wanted to... what an idiot i was to take that away from her.\n\n keep in mind shes always felt like people didnt care or listen to her for years up until recently so that was crucial for her. again, completely fucked up on my part and i wish i had never done that why do i keep fucking up with this girl? she tell me she doesnt forgive me and a few days later she ends up forgiving me but telling me what i did was wrong. \n\ni understand, but on the night she told me she forgave me... you guessed it, fuckup #5. i messaged her a thing about how i still care about her and she means a lot to me and im so glad she forgave me glad to have her as a friend. and i meant all that it made me happy to send, now heres where i went wrong. after sending that i didnt really get a response to it which i shouldve known meant \"back off man i dont feel this way at the moment\" but i didnt because im an idiot.\n so naturally i sent her something a day later asking if the message meant anything to her and would i be able to earn back the trust i had destroyed. this was basically me being selfish and going do you still like me after i had screwed up not but a few days prior. she responds upset to it saying that i need to chill out and shes upset with me for being pushy so i just drop it. \n\na day and a half (the half leading up to now) passes where she doesnt talk to me. shes messaged me today a little bit saying that again i need to chill out which is perfectly understandable. so thats what i plan to do, i dont think she really believes that im going to though based on her response. i think at this point, if it wasnt already, our relationship is over that has no chance of returning. but as of now, im kinda worried whether we'll even have that close friendship we used to have.\n\nyou might be asking yourself, why is this ironic what you've done? well, a lot of the times when i talked to her about serious things and attempted to cheer her up, it was involving guys that had done similar things to me. the very things i vowed id never do if i got to be with a girl like her. one of them, the pushy thing where i tried to get over something too fast was what a guy (we'll say s) did to her plenty and shes annoyed about it still because it happened a lot. shes also been lied to a lot and she said one thing she never wanted was someone who lied (similar to another ex) which is exactly what i did. but also since before i ever met her, id always wanted a girl that i could treat right because everyone always thinks they can be that good guy and do things right. i really thought i could and it was my philosophy that i would never mistreat a girl if i got one, look what happened. i hurt her probably as much if not more than her ex's have. what kind of a monster does that make me? i dont know whats gonna happen from here, but i do know that its all my fault for how this has gone. \n\nwhile im on the topic though, id like to get some frustration out. mainly that inner me wishes k never existed because of all hes done to her and i would have never been this over pushy asshole if this situation hadnt arisen and made my confidence die. its a shitty excuse and it doesnt make it right, but i felt like saying that. i probably dont deserve her anyway at this point for all ive done to her, i can agree with that. but i just wish i could've had this and done right to her instead of treating her like the very scum i warned her never to be with. \n\nid like to know what people on here think, yes even if its completely negative because i did screw up big time here it was my fault all of this. sorry to her, sorry to everyone whos facepalming at what a jackass ive been and how little i deserve to be happy with her. i agree completely, many bonehead moves on my part i should have never even thought about.\nSummary:  i fucked my chances with the girl of my dreams and ill never get to hold her hand or even say i like you again. <br>\nQuestion",

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: hi reddit. so tifu, well actually i am currently in the middle of this fu. this is a story of panic and fear - both of which are emotions i'm dealing with right now. i'm hoping writing it down will make me feel better, whilst also keeping me busy until i get some resolution.\n\n\nyesterday, at 11.55pm it was the hand in for my final university assignment. a 12,000 word dissertation that of course i'd left to the last minute (truth: i'm an adrenaline procrastinator). i'd spent all the last week working on this baby in the vain hope of getting a pass and yesterday, at 11pm i'd finally hit word count. 101 references were in. contents page done, front cover, acknowledgements... all done. at around about 11.20pm i go to hand in. commence fu.\n\nnow, the system our university uses is called moodle and the hand in is done through an upload process called turnitin. i've been using this system for 4 years, never had any real problems with it. you log in to moodle, select the module you want to submit for, select assignment>submit>upload>submit through turnitin, then (depending on how busy the sytem is) you get an email receipt. easy, right? \n\nso, i get to the submit page and everything looks different. it's been changed. i don't get it, i start panicking. my tired bloodshot eyes scour the page, grasping for something they recognise... but wait! upload icon! that's got to be it! oh alcoholly1985, you're such a drama queen! i select the file 'complete dissertation', press upload, confirmation of upload pops up and boom. done.\n\nnow, just a quick aside: i need to come clean about something reddit, because i'm not telling you the whole truth. the truth would include the fact that due to it being my last ever piece of coursework and i had gotten to the point where i was just desperate to get *anything* in... i'd had a glass of celebratory wine... before i'd actually submitted it. this wine was partying away in my stomach by itself, because i'd been working so hard i hadn't actually eaten. \n\nso, to recap: i'd uploaded the file on this strange new set up, whilst slightly pissed. i continued to celebrate with my mother and had a couple more glasses (and a shower, i had been in work mode for 5 days straight without a shower. i smelt like 3 day dead tramp in a compost heap). of course, i decided that i should double check that i'd submitted the right file before the actual deadline passed. so log in, go through the same process, there's my dissertation file sitting in the uploads, imprinted with my hopes and dreams... but there's some red writing above it: **draft not submitted**.\n\nnow, the way turnitin works is that it automatically checks for plagiarism by scanning your work and searching the internet, online journal databases, your friends work, your own past work and lots of other stuff. this then gives you a % of likeness to other work, so you can see if maybe you missed out an in cite reference, or been caught out for being a rotten cheater. at undergraduate level, we were bullied into referencing right from the beginning, so were given only one turnitin link for each assignment. however, at postgrad level there are a lot of students that join from other institutions and countries who may not have used references at all, so a 'draft submission' link was added to allow you to see whether you've got to change something. i never use this link, i'm confident that all my work is my own and i'm pretty hot on the in cite referencing front. so when i saw the **draft not submitted** all red and angry, i thought 'oh yeah, well i didn't submit a draft, that's fine' and toddled (truth: staggered) off to bed to sleep (truth: collapse across my bed in a wine-induced coma).\n\nthis morning, day after deadline, i wake up with relief and that gnawing worry you feel after submitting any coursework that's worth 33% of your final grade. i pick up my phone and see that i still haven't received my receipt of submission. i'm only a little worried as receipts often take longer than they're supposed to, especially if you hand in close to deadline time (truth: i'm a repeat offender, closest i've been is 4 minutes before). i decide to check again on moodle just to make sure it is in fact just a glitch in the system. i log in, go through to my submission and grades and there, in damning, accusatory letters are the words :**no submission. grade: 0.00% (dropped)**. i panic. i'm shaking, my heart is racing and i'm starting to cry. but hold on - i uploaded it! i race over to the link on my phone and i can see that the upload is still there. i take a screenshot (so i can prove i uploaded *something*) and get straight onto facebook to message my supervisor. i explain that the submission process was different, that i **had** uploaded my work but it hadn't gone through... it was around then that i realised the **draft not submitted** was not in fact instructing me that i hadn't submitted a draft, it was telling me that my upload *was* a draft and had not been submitted. i know, i'm an idiot. complete and utter fool.\n\nmy supervisor gets straight back to me and explains she's on annual leave, but she'll email the course director and see what it says on the system. i apologise and say i'll email him. so i just have. and now here i am waiting to see if i've failed the largest and most important piece of work i've ever done. brilliant.\n\n \n\n**edit**: as my mind is a complete mess right now, it's been brought to my attention that i didn't explain why i'd have to redo the report. at my uni, if you submit work and it fails (which includes late submissions), you're not allowed to resubmit the same work. now, i'm not sure where i stand atm (cause of the whole draft issue). if my uploaded file isn't counted, then i can submit a blank word document which will become the file that relates to the 0% grade. i'd then be given another chance to hand in with a cap at 40%, which would be my actual report. if this document is counted as a late submission, then i'd have to redo the whole thing with a new research question. either way it's looking a bit shit.\n\n**update**: for people that were wondering, i finally heard back! so apparently i **did not** submit my work properly! the course director replied telling me that i was right, moodle had changed slightly, and to enter my final submission i had to scroll all the way down and *select the 'final submission' button'*. seriously, i'm so bloody stupid. this would process the submission through turnitin (truth: i'm a complete idiot). i replied asking if i would be penalised for a late submission, he replied:\n\n\n\"there is no penalty for a late submission... it is an automatic 0%...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...but i can see you tried to upload before the deadline so it's fine.\" (and yes, he did it so i'd have to scroll down the email!).\n\nso all's fine!

The summary should be one or two sentences long\\Post: Text: a little bit of background. as an english speaking child in an immigrant family i tend to do a lot of work for them that involves interacting with the english speaking world (which is quite a lot). one of these chores include going online to check my fathers lottery tickets.\n\ni had probably planned this fap for almost a full week now, five days to be exact. i already had a hand on my cock and another on my keyboard when my dad got back from work. i heard him from my window but thought little of it because i knew he would be occupied in the washroom for a good half an hour.  as i'm in the middle of my search for \"cute asian doggystyle\" i hear feet approaching my door, so i quickly close my browser and get my hand out of my pants. it was wet but not enough to draw attention as i was just only starting to stroke. when my dad entered the room he handed me a pile of lottery tickets for me to check, there are no words to exclaim my enthusiasm, but i told him i would and he left them on my lamp table. sex drive gone and hand smelling of  pre-cum i wiped down and started checking the tickets. i had never scored more than $5 but this time one came out with just over $100 so i yelled to my dad about the winnings and answered my moms call to go down for dinner. i rubbed my hands with soap and sprayed my crotch with febreeze and headed down. maybe it was something in the food but after dinner my dick was calling for round two so i finished eating early and told my parents i would finish my homework. when i got to my computer i knew what i wanted and where to find it so i moved my keyboard out of the way for better viewing and knocked over most of the tickets on my desk in the process. i didn't really care much at the time and went into a phase of furious masturbation with a spectacular ending. feeling satisfied i closed my browser and reaches for the tissues. finding none i decided to just take a shower,hoping no one would see me walking to the bathroom. however as i was thinking this through in my mind my dad knocked on the door and asked for the ticket. in a hurry i grabbed the nearest piece of paper i could find and wiped my hand on it. my dad entered the room as i was stuffing the ticket down my crotch. i told him i lost it in the mess on the floor and to return later for it after i finished my homework. he agreed and left my room. i started looking through the mess for the familiar numbers but no luck, then i  realized there was only one place left to check. and as i unrolled the cum stained lotto ticket wrapped around my balls i realized the paper i grabbed had been the winning lotto ticket. \n\nright now my dad still thinks i'm doing homework but i do t know when he's going to check up on me. i can probably try to redeem it myself if the cum stains hasn't damaged the ticket too much but if not i'll have to pull it from my own pocket.\n\n \n\ngot a winning lotto ticket for my dad, wiped my ejaculant on it.\nSummary: enjoyed playing the lottery and made a win. \nQuestion: What might happen to you if you made the win and your dad didn't",

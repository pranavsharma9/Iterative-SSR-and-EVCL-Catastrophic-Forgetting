I seem to have a 50:50 change of getting the load wire right first try, but you just switch wires if you miss. On 3 gang boxes I used a pig tail to tie into the common and ground as they were getting a bit much for the wire nuts I used. Connectivity is fast and easy. We use the Smart Life app to connect and after we connected the first switch to our Alexa the rest were picked up automatically. For exterior lights these are terrific. The are great for scheduling lights when you are away from the house. We also use one to help with the morning alarm, amazing what sounds kids can sleep through. I really like the mini light on the switch that tells you the light is off and help you find it in the dark. I was only going to install a couple but now I'm headed towards the whole house.

After returning the damage bike, the second bike arrived a week later and appeared to be in good condition. Assembly was a challenge as the instructions were blurry, parts were missing, and the tool that was included was not the right size for our bike. But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don\u2019t just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again. And if I had it to do over, I\u2019d GO TO THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS WEAK OPERATION. P.S. My son doesn\u2019t like the bike at all. He wants the balance bike he was riding at the bike shop while we were waiting for the repair! I should have just gone with the experts from the start.

The pieces dont line up, and one of the pins is missing. Even with my entire body balanced on top of the peg, I couldn't get the rubber compressed down enough to get the pin through, and even if I had, the pin meant to hold it in place (one of which is missing) is litterally just a pin the sits in a hole without any tension or resistance to keep it in place.

I enjoyed this series up till book 3. Now for the review. This book is a disaster. This is not a litrpg book anymore, it is a romance novel, a poorly written romance novel. The grinding for levels is boring and lacks interesting detail. Story elements that had great potential were aweful. Once again, two to three times a chapter every character talks about how much they love everyone. It is repetitive and lacking in so many ways. The words love and kiss occur over a hundred times a piece throughout this book. They are over used. The assassin plot twist at the end of the last book was great and the author went and made that boring in this book. A potentially great story was screwed up so badly. I am extremely disappointed with how this series turned out. This book was not worth the price tag. I will not be buying the next book because 3 books have been written in a similar manner now. It is repetitive and boring.\nSentiment: 0.8 \nQuestion: What is the tone of this review? \nAnswer: The tone is negative. \n\n\nQuestion2: How can I make",

They contacted me, said they would refund my money and send me another one and asked me to remove my bad review, which I did. I received the second one. That one did not have a charging cable and the charging cable from the previous one would not fit into the slot for the charging cable. I think it's offset somehow so the cable won't actually go in. I think they send out inferior products, then if they get a bad review, send a new one hoping to only get good reviews. I won't be deleting this review.

I should have ordered one of these A LONG time ago! This is so handy! I bought it to make rope fondant by twisting two cords around each other and it is SO MUCH EASIER than rolling my own fondant and being consistent. I'm excited to try the other shapes and figure out a way to use them. It's not a fast process - because it takes time to twist the bar around to push the fondant out, but it creates a great product for your time.

Charging takes an extremely long time, and concerns of an electrical short or excessive heat from the incorrect battery have come up as well.

The individual pipes on the poles can get a little loose if you turn it suddenly so you do have to be careful.. and if we wait for longer than 2 days, we have to use multiple bags.. p.s- we clean the rake part easily with a hose and we twist the handle part of the grocery store plastic bags to secure the bags in place so we haven\u2019t had any messes on our hands!

Was on phone with customer service for an hour having to literally ARGUE with an agent -- who refused for a long time to transfer me to a supervisor -- and then with a supervisor. After all that, no resolution. All they offered to do was pick up the machine and send it for repairs...but we'd have to stay home, waiting for pick-up, for a 2-3 day period -- which could not even be scheduled for a particular week. (We're leaving for vacation in a couple of days.) Or -- get this! -- they'd email us a shipping label so we could take the machine to UPS at our convenience, but it would take them 2-3 DAYS TO SEND THE EMAIL. An email! After that it would be about a month before we got the machine back. Utter absurdity. **** Like many other reviewers here, I've bought this machine twice -- the first one was good for a couple of years (not as long as I'd expect from this brand), then started pouring water out the bottom instead of through the coffee basket, so I figured I'd just gotten a bit of a dud or the problem was somehow my fault, and I bought a new one. The new one is truly awful -- sounds like a combine harvester, and now, after just 5 months, it makes nothing but sludge with black crema and a half-inch of grounds on the bottom of a weak, bad-tasting cup of coffee. I've cleaned and re-settled all the external parts every way I can think of, to no avail. I'd expect better of a machine that cost half of much. Cuisinart used to make top-quality products....\nSentiment: 1 \nQuestion: What is the main issue with this product? \nOptions: It does not work well. It is faulty. 20 \nExplanation",

It's pretty hard to be dazzled by red light because of the way the eye works, but this sure as hell dazzled me when I first turned it on, facing my eyes. WOW. There are lots of modes to cycle through, from short and medium flashes to dim up, dim down to solid ON. It takes a minute to get used to holding down the button to turn it off, but once you've got that, the light \"remembers\" what mode it was in when you turned it off, and comes back to that mode when you turn it back on, which to me is exactly the right behavior.

These refills are way to thick to fit. I used pliers to open up the curler area and to make the refill fit. I rigged it well enough but the refills are way too squishy as in my eye lashes the curler is unable to hold my lashes. A complete waste of time and money. In addition, I ruined my perfectly functioning eye lash curler to try to get the squishy eye lash curler refills to fit. These refills were comparable to using a sponge to curl eyelashes.

But I am of the opinion that it is a sad and disappointing waste of materials, as well as time and money. The construction is awful and there is a degree of difficulty even for those experienced in DIY furniture assembly. The parts don't fit together properly, the Cam Lock aluminum hardware is soft and malfunctioning, and the pins pop out and are exposed through the cracks where the side boards and interior shelves should fit snugly and tightly. The end result is a lopsided piece of furniture, with misaligned doors, that can't be trusted to hold any weight. I had ordered the two other matching cabinets, the large and medium size, and had similar problems with their design flaws, and so decided against ordering the small cabinet as intended. At least the cabinets are still standing after a few months. Not this entertainment center! One day I moved it forward a foot or so to plug something into the wall behind it. I moved it back and opened one of the doors. To my chagrin, it fell out into my hand as it reached the open position in the center. Then I tried the other door and alas! the same. When I stood back to inspect I saw what appears to be warping to the bottom board. The doors simply fell from the tracks when they reached the low spot in the bend. That uncomfortable feeling of having been ripped off returned and I junked the thing. I'm not sure what to do with the cabinets as they were a set, but I am quite confident they won't last long either. Heaven forbid I need to move them at all! What a shame.\nSentiment: 0 \n",

I was excited to try a natural way to dye hair and a product that CLAIMED to be able to dye dark hair fun colors. No surprise that unbleached hair will not dye a fun color. I thought blue smoke would be a nice dark blue on my natural dark brown hair. After leaving it in for 2 hours (recommended by the website) I rinsed it out and got jet black with a couple blue patches where my hair has been bleached in the past. Needless to say I will not be wasting my money on this again. Go to Sally\u2019s and buy bleach and ion semi-permanent color if you have dark hair.

The wet and dry wipes meant to clean the screen before you put the protector on both came completely dry. Removing dust/air pockets from this screen protector is a no go. If you try to use a card to push air out of the side air will leak in front the sides, create air bubbles, and never go back down. Don\u2019t waste your money with this, get a screen protector that comes with a mounting bracket and actual cleaning supplies.

Mine will be just fine.\" Well think again with this PC, because you're going to blow $1,000 on a piece of crap. Within two weeks of it arriving, the hard drive started to make \"the click of death\" noise. (Looked up the hard drive they used and it has awful reviews). I got into contact with the Cyberpower's customer service and attempted to RMA the hard drive. A week later I got an email from them saying something along the lines of \"We're not going to replace the hard drive because when we received it, we observed a small dent on the outside which voids your warranty, have a nice day.\" It was completely fine before shipping and adequately protected, I wouldn't put it past them to have made the dent themselves. Unfortunately I didn't have photographic evidence to dispute so I angrily purchased a replacement. Fast forward a few months, when everything on my PC starts to lag like crazy. Take it into a shop for a diagnostic and behold, the DVI port for the graphics card has gone bad. I'm currently stuck in RMA hell with them trying to get that replaced as well. I've had to physically print out multiple forms and go through several departments trying to get them to accept my return. All I can say is that I am never purchasing anything from this retailer ever again. TLDR: Cheap parts, multiple things broken, poor service, all around overpriced. Look elsewhere and stay away from CyberpowerPC.\nSentiment: 1 \nExplanation: This review is negative.

I will say that the package the wig came in had been opened already (the top above the ziplock part was already cut), so this may have been a previously returned item placed in the wrong area...or it's just an incorrect description and picture...not sure which, but I will need to return it.\nSentiment: : negative\nQuestion: What was the reason for the negative sentiment? \nAnswer: It was because I thought I got the right color but instead I",

However, the dress I received is made of 95% RAYON and 5% spandex (this is stated on the tag). Based on my experience with previous dresses made of a rayon spandex combo, this tends to be an unpleasantly clingy material that doesn't drape well, tends to get holes, and pills after a few washes. I tried this dress on, and as with other dresses I've had made of this material, it clings in a very unflattering way. I will be returning this dress and I'm very disappointed.

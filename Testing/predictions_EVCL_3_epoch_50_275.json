The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: happened when i was 11.  a way-long time ago.\n\nmy best friend and i were walking from her house to my neighbor's house for a little babysitting gig.  i was, what you might call... an \"adventuresome\" kid.  i was also just starting to learn how to curse.  i'm a fucking pro at that shit now, but i was  only11 then, so still pretty green.\n\nanyway, this was right when the sport bikes were getting really popular.  so, my friend and i reached the top of the hill on a long cul-de-sac.  this guy on a crotch rocket turned onto the street and opened up his throttle.  i was not only adventurous, i was fairly mal-adjusted, with a hefty dose of adhd thrown in just for fun.  i interpreted that screaming engine as a challenge.  a challenge which i must conquer because seriously, i was a fucking *odd* kid.\n\ni remember nothing about the accident itself or most of the year before it.  so, obviously i didn't win that game of chicken.  i remember waking up in the icu and the room was spinning and i had the worst headache of my life and i was puking.  i knew my mom was next to me.  i thought, \"i must've gotten really sick and had to go to the hospital\".  beyond that, i have a very vague memory of a big, painfully bright, round light right above me.  after going to work in operating rooms, i figured out it was the light in the trauma bay that i was remembering.  i had recurring nightmares for several years about being somehow confined and a bunch of people bustling over me and a really loud sound that was coming from everywhere, like a roar or some kind of very deep vibration, and i was very confused and scared.  i'm guessing that's some kind of memory of the helicopter on a backboard.  my final injury count was one broken left clavicle, one shattered left elbow, a fractured skull, bruised abdominal organs (like, *all* of them), bruised lungs, and a traumatic head injury that left me in a coma for about a week and caused permanent frontal lobe damage.  i'm have zero impulse control and my short term memory is like swiss cheese.  i'm a lot of fun at parties! \n\nanyway, all of that was to tell you that rest of the story is all secondhand, from a deposition of my friend that i read many years later:\n\nthe motorcycle was flying toward us at full throttle.  i ran from the curb to cross in front of him, waving my hand in the air flipping him off, shouting, \"eat shit!!\"  (btw, why tf did my neighbors allow me to babysit their kid??)  at the last second i realized i was truly fucked and the rider realized the same thing about himself.  in the course of a millimoment, i froze like a deer in the headlights, as the rider made a desperate attempt to lay down his bike, going about 60mph (according to the accident scene investigation).  he lost control of his motorcycle and it veered into me, hitting my leg with the front tire. \n\ni flew over the handlebars and",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: this is the same ole did not happen today, but actually happened last year.\n\ni woke up one morning, got on the computer for an hour doing usual stuff, then realized i still had not eaten breakfast. i look at the clock and it's like noon now so i am like \"fuck, going to get yelled at by my parents if i don't say i ate something.\" so i run to the kitchen, grab a breakfast bar out of the pantry then spend a minute deciding what i wanted to drink. i then decided \"it's afternoon now, nobody is going to care if i drink some coke for breakfast.\" so i grabbed a mexicola because the glass bottle cokes are among the best things in this world.\n\nnow so that you guys know, these mexicola bottles need a bottle opener to open, and i am not a professional with bottle openers, and usually i panic whenever i try to use them. so i proceed to bring the bottle opener to the cap of the coke and get it all in position and start panicking trying to keep the coke stable for the upcoming attempt to open it. then it happened, i feel a sting on my right index finger, and the bottle just goes flying over. my first action was to recover the bottle and put it stable again after it had spilled some of its contents on the counter. then i looked at the top of my finger and cringed slightly. at the middle joint part of my finger that looks like a knee cap when you bend it was entirely cut open very deep where i could see white stuff in the wound. what i found strange at the time was i felt absolutely no pain at all, just discomfort looking at my finger, so i then thought \"well shit, can already tell this is going to be a problem for a bit until it heals.\" i had to keep my finger straight because if i bent it at all, the wound would open up entirely and my meaty insides would be revealed to everything. i walked to the bathroom first laughing out loud to myself, (probably making my brother in his room think i was crazy), and grabbed some tissue to wrap my finger in case it suddenly started spraying and gushing blood everywhere. it did not end up ever bleeding surprisingly, and i wouldn't of had a problem if it did because i already have a bleeding disorder causing me to see my own blood all the time.\n\nafter wrapping up my finger, i ran over to the workshop my parents were working in and told them i was going to need one big mother fucking band-aid. my mother then comes with me and i show her my absolutely awful looking finger in the kitchen. i tell her before she grabs anything to treat my finger that i wanted that still opened mexicola bottle put away before anything because i was still going to drink that shit later. as she goes to do this, i suddenly begin to feel dizzy, (this is like 5 minutes after i cut my finger) and i find myself grabbing the kitchen counter for support. at this point, i lose consciousness entirely and see some crazy images and hear wave-like noises as if i were at the ocean. i suddenly wake up from this weird drug trip in my mind in a kitchen chair, with my mom standing over me. she tells me that she had put the mexicolas away, which i did remember asking her to before",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: as is typical fashion this tifu happened about a week ago. it was just another morning. wake up, hit the snooze button, and pray for an apocalypse so i\ufe0f wouldn\u2019t have to go to work. i\ufe0f hear my roommate stir awake one room over and head to the shower. he struggles hard in the morning and loves taking long showers. which i\u2019m ok with cause he also has his shit clock on point. dude destroys the john, takes a 20 minute shower, and it still smells like bigfoot\u2019s dick in there. every! day! well since we\u2019re not do for a near earth fly by from any comets soon i\ufe0f work my way downstairs and get a pot of coffee brewing. all was well. birds chirping and all that shit. coffee is doing god\u2019s work and all seems par for the course. but after three sips i could tell something was off. the birds stopped singing. time slowed down. this was my defining moment. within a fraction of a second i knew today would be different. today would be the day my legacy was born. my stomach contorted and released a beckoning growl. the pit of my bowels longed for release. the brown dogs of hell were barking and about to break off the leash. i\ufe0f began to go upstairs when i remember my roommates in the shower. fuck fuck fuck. (for context i\ufe0f only have one bathroom in my house and it has a clear sliding door for the shower.) bathroom was a no go as my roommate and i\ufe0f aren\u2019t that close and this shit was on a timer about to run out. well, onto plan b. this shit is happening whether i\ufe0f want it to or not. it\u2019s 7:15am and i\u2019ve been up for a total of 20 minutes. it\u2019s 6 degrees fahrenheit (-14c for the non-americans) outside so that\u2019s not gunna work. so, in my morning daze and panic i\ufe0f grabbed the paper towels from my kitchen and i\ufe0f head to my basement. it has a finished cement floor and holds all the forgotten treasures from ghost of roommates past. the plan was simple. shit on the floor. use paper towels to clean it up. done. well as i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed by now i\u2019ll queue the fu. in my most beautifully brilliant moment i\ufe0f spot an old frying pan laden with dust and rust. surely this pan won\u2019t see use again so why not shit in it? right? without a moment to spare i\ufe0f drop trou, bend down neanderthal style, and lay a thick mud pie pancake into the frying pan. it all worked so well. the shit was contained and easy to move. the agony in my colon subsided and the paper towels did their job. as i\ufe0f begin to stand up i\ufe0f lose my balance and stutter step. my heel lands directly on the frying pan handle and catapults a literal pile of shit. it goes fucking everywhere! the back of my legs. the sides of 5 or so random boxes. all over a weight bench and numerous odds and ends, none of which belong to me. i\ufe0f use the rest of the towels and clean myself up best as possible. and as any good american would do i head straight to fucking work with a pile shit covered legs and"

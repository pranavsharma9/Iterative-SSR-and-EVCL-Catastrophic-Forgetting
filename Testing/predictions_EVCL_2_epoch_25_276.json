        "You will be given a sentence describing an experience. You need to classify its sentiment, which could only be either positive or negative. \nExperience: I can't recommend these pants enough. They fit like a glove and are incredibly comfortable. I love working out in them or just lounging around the house. I find myself disappointed when I have to wear other yoga pants because these are dirty. They are always my go to pick because they don't cling too tight like other yoga pants. Also the pocket is perfect for smartphones or a small wallet. I've never had an issue with anything falling out. Love them!!\nSentiment: satisfied\n",
        "You will be given a sentence describing an experience. You need to classify its sentiment, which could only be either positive or negative. \nExperience: I wish I had read the reviews more carefully earlier. These mats are leaky. The first time I used the it was for ink watercoloring. The pigment leak through and stained my desk. The mat was permanently stained also. I used high quality mat (made by Ranger) earlier and never had this problem. These mats have rough surfaces, completely different from the smooth surface from high quality ones. The only thing I like about this product is the size. But what's the use if it leaks? Pretty much equivalent to directly crafting on my desk.\nSentiment:  (1) Negative\n"

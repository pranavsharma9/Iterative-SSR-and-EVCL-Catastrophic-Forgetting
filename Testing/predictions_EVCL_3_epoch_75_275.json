The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: so the last few weeks ive been contemplating on upgrading to windows 10. yesterday night, i finally pulled the trigger and decided to update to windows 10, eagerly waiting for it to upgrade so i can fap using my brand spanking new software (considering i haven't fapped that day).\n\nanyway, after a couple hours, the upgrade is complete. the first thing i notice is that all my files are not where it has been. i was like oh horyy shit and desperately started looking everywhere. i managed to find them under \"windows old\" because i actually needed the old documents folder for my school stuff, i cut it to the original cdrive location. however, i realized many other of my items have been displaced, notably all my games. so i had to make shortcuts to all my games again. desperately hoping they are still saved. i also realized that windows 10 operated really slow. opening the control panel would take 15 seconds, something which cannot be tolerated by a first world peasant like me. looked for answers on internet, learned that i should manually allocate how much ram gets allocated to certain programs and whatnot. computer did get much faster afterwards. my lust for fapping was barely contained at this point.\ni managed to stumble upon the windows update tab, where an update was waiting for me to happen. upon installing that update, all my files did come back to place. god damn it. i needlessly moved and restored all my documents tab and still have not fapped. it was 9:30 pm.\n\nunfortunately, with this update, my wifi stopped working. my wifi connection, even when firm and strong, did not identify and could not connect, due to \"one or more network protocols not in place\" (unless i was next to the moden/router). driven by one of the strongest urges to fap in the history of mankind, and a general frustration of having no internet, i desperately began looking for answers on my phone. during this event, i picked up many computer knowledge, such as command prompts, regedit, tcp/ip reset, etc. unfortunately, even after looking for three hours and resetting the router/modem many times in the process, i could not find the fix for my wifi, nor the fix for my fap appetite.\nat 12:30, i gave up, tired, aching, and defeated, and decided to just fap using my downloaded emergency porn videos on my external drive. i was kinda sad, for i expected some glorious windows 10 porn app shit, but instead had to settle for shit i fapped to at least 8 times.\n\nthis morning, i tried once more to find the root of my issues. one of the more promising methods involved exporting hkey registry for network adapter from a windows 7 computer to the windows 10, and replacing the exported hkey registry (apparently computers older than two years have this problem a lot). however, because my science knowledge is not 50 (fallout lol), i could not export the registry. in the end, i gave up this afternoon and reverted back to windows 7 and fapped to three different videos at one.\n\n \nmy urge to fap can lead me into many things, as it did last night. even though the solution was not very satisfying, it still was satisfying to solve the problem, especially",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: as you can guess, this took place a few months ago.\n\na little backstory: over the summer i was a wilderness canoe guide at a boy scout camp in northern minnesota. my job was to take groups of kids and adults into the woods for 5-9 days and teach them the ropes of paddling and navigating the minnesotan/canadian woods. \n\nso this happened on my second trip of the summer. we were 6 days into a 9 day trip in canada, and we were about half a day behind schedule due to inclement weather(mostly dangerously high wind/big waves). i knew that this day was gonna be a rough start, with 6 portages(which is where you carry the canoe over land because the lake ends) in the morning alone. it starts out well though: we hammer out the first two and are looking for the third by 9 am. \n\nnow here's the thing about canada: ontario parks service really tries to make it a wilderness, so trails are quite rugged. some disappear into the woods, some are consumed by swamps, and some are plain gone. to compensate for this, during training i was taught how to distinguish spots where a trail should be, like finding rocky landings and dips in the treeline. \n\ngetting back to the story, were on this lake forks off on the end where the trail is. according to our 35 year old maps, its on the right end of the far side. as we get closer, were having a helluva time trying to find it. but wait, whats this? a patch of rocks about 2 feet wide! why, that could be a portage! so myself and one of the adult leaders land and check it out. now i think i see a trail and tell him that i'll check it out. i said that it looks like a decent trail and that i shouldn't need a buddy. before i leave, though, he gives me his whistle, so that, just in case the canoe guide gets lost, i can signal where i am. so with no map, compass, or water, i confidently head into the bush. \n\nit takes me a solid five minutes of fallowing i don't even know what to realize that this is not a trail at all. i say alright, we'll look elsewhere and try to keep moving, no biggie. i turn around and start to head back. now i don't know how i didn't notice but it takes about twice as long for me to get to the edge of land, and at that it's not even really water that i hit. it's a swamp! so great, i made a wrong turn. no big deal, because i remembered from the map that it was located just past the left point of the lake my crew was on. i just had to turn towards that and walk a ways. easy.\n\nno, not easy. apparently i have the directional skills of a headless chicken on a turntable, because i ended up at the next lake over!!! this is where i realized that i've fucked up pretty bad. i think that if i find the trail that i'm sure is there, then i can just turn right and head to where my group is, right? \n\nnope, it took me 45 minutes to even find a path. and",

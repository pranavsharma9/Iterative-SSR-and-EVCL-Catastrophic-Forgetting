        "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text. Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: first off yeah this was yesterday. ok, so setting the scene, i was camping at this beautiful place near arcata called prairie creek. wildlife everywhere, the grass was green, and (unlike most camping spots) i could occasionally get reception. what else could i ask for. so my brother and i decided to go on a nice long bike ride that travelled a little south of where our camp was, and consequentially a little south of where our map extended to. luckily we had already biked down some portions of the trail so we kind of knew our way around. so we start the ride and it's fairly easy going, we know our way around. until we pass by a warehouse that we don't remember from the previous ride. but hey we figure we must already be on that part of the trail we had not yet traversed. it was only a little concerning that we hadn't noticed the trailhead that were supposed to have. however this actually isn't where we had messed up. it was only later when we got to another trailhead that seemed to say the way home was pointing in the direction we had just come (this was at the center of our loop so it should have been pointing ahead of us) that we got confused. so naturally, we decided to ditch this trail and converge onto the seemingly unoccupied road. now we're pedaling along this fairly small and nondescript road, when the traffic starts to grow. and grow. and grow. until (while passing an interstate 101 sign) we realize we are (illegally) riding on the freeway. luckily, this freeway was way out in the woods so it was at most two lanes, but because of this it had some nasty blind spots along some bends in the road. and our story concludes with us biking along the 101, breaking the law (and probably putting our lives at some moderate risk), and having almost zero idea of how to get to the camp. magically about six miles later we arrive safely at our site, and have now lived to tell the tale.'\n\nNow give your output.\nSummarize:. \" first, I was in a beautiful area with green grass and wildlife. I went on my bike with my bro and we went down the wrong",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: so this happened about 10 years ago up in a small isolated camp ground. me and my friend were about 11 or 12 at the time and we were running around playing \tsomething and he stepped on an underground hornets nest. now my friend his highly allergic to bee and hornets and the closest hospital was about an hour away. i told him to quickly move his foot and i will step on it so he can run away and not get stung. as soon as he was far enough away i moved my foot and about 15or 20 pissed off hornets came flying out of the nest. most of them when right for my ankles and feet(i was bare foot for some reason) and 3 or 4 of them flew up my shorts and started stinking my dick and balls. they only stopped stinging when i raninto the lake that was near by. i don't know if you have ever been stung by hornets but they will just keep stinging and fuck up everything. i had atleast 10 welts on my junk and 20 or 30 on my feet ankles. the worst was on decided to sting the tip of my penis so it hurt to pee for about a week while it healed. my friend was lucky and got away with no stings luckily.\n\n \n\ni know i spelled the tiltle wrong'\n\nNow give your output.\nSummarize:i was stinked on the junk by a hornet. \nI got stunk in the crotch by an angry horned insect.\n",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: i\u2019m not a very interesting person, nor do i lead a very interesting life. i\u2019m just a person who wanted to make frozen pizza because there was nothing left in his house. this just happened a couple hours ago, so here\u2019s my story.\n\ni just got home from school, and all i had eaten up to that moment was one fruit snack (breakfast), a couple of carrots (because our school food is shitty and the only thing they can\u2019t mess up is vegetables), and some water. i open every single cupboard, search every little nook and cranny for hidden sweets, yet i can\u2019t find anything, and to top it all off, it\u2019s too cold to go to the gas station. until i open the freezer.\n\nthere, in all it\u2019s glory next to an empty box of eggos, is a supreme pizza. i almost faint with excitement, grab the pizza, and shove it into the oven. about 14 minutes later i hear my oven alarm scream at me, and i run into my kitchen.\n\none of my friends taught me a way to save dishes. instead of putting the pizza on a rack or plate to cool it down, just put it on the little circle of cardboard that it came wrapped up in. i didn\u2019t know if this was a normal thing that everybody did, but i thought it was genius. so i grab the piece of cardboard and the pizza cutter, right? and so i position the cardboard under the rack so i could slide the pizza onto it and put it on top of the oven. unfortunately, i only got halfway there before i fuck up big time.\n\nfor some reason, the cardboard decides to fold in and slide the pizza all the way to the bottom of the oven. i\u2019m thinking it can\u2019t be that bad, so i take a rubber spatula and a regular spatula and position them under the pizza to lift it up. unfortunately, there\u2019s not a lot of space under it, so i accidentally burn a line straight through the pizza from the rack above it. great, well now there\u2019s no cheese or anything covering a fourth of my pizza. the spatulas aren\u2019t going to work, so i just grab some tongs. all i have to do is grab the crust and pull the pizza back to safety. well, fuck, that didn\u2019t work, because it just crumbled the crust and most of it fell off!\n\ngreat. now most of my pizza is ruined. so i throw out the tongs and decide to just use my fingers. i didn\u2019t really know what i was doing, so as soon as i tried to pull it out with my bare hands, i accidentally touch the same rack that fucked up my cheese and scald my knuckles. i\u2019m not really even thinking anymore, and i\u2019m hungry as hell. i have nothing left to lose because now i screwed up most of my pizza and there\u2019s no other option. i\u2019m just gonna scoot my hands under the pizza and pull it out as quick as possible. lucky for me, i pull it out! it\u2019s okay, so i scoot it under the cardboard again (this time using both hands), and cut it up to eat. i take a bite. and it tastes like shit. it tasted like cardboard. not like the frozen cardboard i placed it in, like, real cardboard.\n\nso i go",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: my so and i really enjoy spicy food and frequently cook with habaneros and ghost peppers. today i decided to oven-dry some particularly good farmer's market habs that needed used. after processing them i washed my hands twice and tested their spiciness (by licking my fingers, not by accidentally rubbing my eyes). two washes was not enough for these peppers; in fact it took 5 total washes. i was fine for several minutes. after some time though my hands dried significantly and i got a lot of small cracks in my skin. apparently they were not as spice-free as i had hoped and they've been burning quite badly since (about half an hour now). my hands are shaking and it feels similar to a steam burn. don't get over-confident when working with habs, wear gloves people.'\n\nNow give your output.\nSummarize:it was a very spicy pepper that made my hand burn.\n\nThe reason for humor was the pepper was very hot. \nThe summary was one sentence long",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: first time poster here, so please forgive any errors or whatnot. i'll edit it if required.\n\ni suppose i should probably start like everyone else and clarify that this did not happen today, but around six years ago.\n\nfor my final a-level chemistry coursework, we all had to choose our own investigations (from a list of experiments provided to us) and produce a report of our findings and so on. i chose to undertake the [belousov-zhabotinsky reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belousov%e2%80%93zhabotinsky_reaction). to cut a long story short, this reaction takes place in dilute sulfuric acid.\n\n\none of the variables that i happened to be testing the effect of was the concentration of said sulfuric acid, and for some reason, my school decided to entrust a 17-year-old male with a bottle of undiluted sulfuric acid to create the required dilutions myself. the only stipulation on this was that i had to wear the plastic gloves they provided me with whenever i was handling the acid.\n\nthese gloves did not seem like the usual thick gloves used by most for handling harmful chemicals; they were thin, clear plastic gloves. but i vaguely remembered something about an acid not being able to burn through plastic, so i figured i was fairly safe.\n\n\nnow, this coursework did quite quickly become repetitive and boring, so in true boys' school fashion, i called my buddies over and uttered the famous last words: \"hey, check this out\" and dripped a few drops of undiluted sulfuric acid on my gloved hands.\n\ni learnt several things that day. a school will happily cut costs at the expense of students' safety. sulfuric acid can and will burn through plastic and skin quickly. sulfuric acid also reacts exothermically with water (it heats up a lot).\n\ndon't drop acid, kids. it fucking hurts.'\n\nNow give your output.\nSummarize:enjoy your summer break. I hope you have a good time and do something fun. \n\nI hope your break is fun and you get to do",

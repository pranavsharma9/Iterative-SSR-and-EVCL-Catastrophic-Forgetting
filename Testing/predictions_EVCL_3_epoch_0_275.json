The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: i usually have to take a morning dump every day as soon as i get out of bed. however, because i had a morning class and was running late, i decided to use the toilet at the building of the lecture hall. so i walked in, dropped my pants, bent over, dropped a dookie, stood back up, and turned around and bent over with my phone out to take a close up picture of the shit so i could send it to my friends on snapchat. now you see, a few of my friends and i have gotten into the odd habit of sending each other shit pics to compare width, length, color and overall quality of the droppings. i was bent over with my ass facing the door and phone in hand practically in the toilet. this was all before i wiped because if i wiped before i took the picture, the toilet paper would cover the substance. so i imagine my butt hole was pretty brown at that moment. \n\nwell apparently, the door had a broken lock...and just as i was snapping the picture, an innocent looking indian man opened the door and was met with a face full of poop covered ass, with the actual hole in full view. i realized what happened and craned my head over, still bent over, too horrified to say anything. he croaked out a \"sorry\" and backed out. out of fear, i quickly wiped and flushed and left the bathroom, only to realize i closed snapchat instinctively as the man opened the door. i had lost the perfect shit pic to go along with this tifu.'\n\nNow give your output.\nSummarize:ing the contents of this post is not as simple as it appears.

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: so this happened last night, when i attended an end of year party at the local student club.\nan ex-girlfriend of mine, who i had dated briefly before i was dumped by her a month ago, also happened to be at this party. i had not seen her since the breakup, (which due to me being emotional i did not take well) so it was a surprise to see here there.\ni saw her at the bar with another girl, who at the time i assumed was a friend of hers. we chatted briefly, though the awkwardness, (and some deep down residual feelings for her) still remained and she gave me her place at the bar to order drinks, then left with her friend.\n\nthe night continued on as much as these nights do, i danced with my friends, chatted with others and (this is going to explain a lot) drinking heavily, as a bonus i didn't even see my ex for most of besides the occasional glimse in the crowd or in the toilet lines.\n\nnear the end of the night, i was chatting with some people in the side room, which is generally lit up and where people store their coats. she then came in with her friend and said they were leaving. we talked for a few minutes, then her friend came over and to my suprise, kissed her, then left to go to the bathroom one more time.\n\n\"huh, what was that about?\" i said \n\n\"uh, well she's my girlfriend sooo...\"\n\ni was suddenly hit by a confusing wave of emotions, regarding this, not helped by the fact i was quite drunk. but i was determined to make light of it.\n\n\"oh, was i so bad you became a lesbian?\" i said jokingly.\n\nthis turned out to be the wrong thing to say.\n\nshe rounded on me, suddenly angry, telling me she was bi. i told her i was never aware of that, she said \"well you never asked\" i replied with \"well how was i supposed to breach the subject?\"\n\nand things escalated from there.\n\nwhat followed was an intense screaming match between us right there in the coatroom,  though my memory of the event is somewhat dim, some choice phrases i do recall her saying  include that she was never really into me at all, that i was a child and needed to grow up  and accusations that i was a homophobe (which was especially galling) then she left, with me shouting obscenities behind her.\n\n \ni tried to maintain my composure for a few minutes, i left and went to a bar to see a friend, hoping  it would take my mind off things, but he must've seen the fight for he said\n\n\"hey man, you shouldn't be talking bad about x,she's a good person\"\n\nthat did it. i couldn't hold it in any longer and started bawling, right there. my friend took me to a side room, and to his credit, once he heard the whole story, told me that he was revising his opinion of her.\n\nbut still the waterworks came, fuck!  people kept walking by(naturally including a girl who i liked and had planned to ask out) and the next day, the girl was still there, we were friends again, her and i were chatting, after a week, \nQuestion:",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.Text: i live in the philippines. i am in college now and i commute on a daily basis. in our country, we ride these passenger jeepneys where we sit on one side and face other people sitting, too, on the other side. if you can't picture it out, i hope this helps (http://i.imgur.com/zw8npwx.jpg). sitting side by side with people means passing other peoples' money for fare. \n\nthere's been quite a threat when riding jeepneys in our place for a while now because of a syndicate, a group of 2-3 huge (like huge, hulk hogan huge) men, wherein they sit beside a victim inside a jeepney and purposely drops spare change (this is important) for fare. as a (good) citizen, we are obliged to help in picking those coins because it's someone else's money and it particularly delays the trip. so when innocently helping this syndicate, locally known as \"hulog piso gang\" in our dialect which is \"drop-coin gang\" in english (yeah, i know it sounds awful), one of them discreetly steals stuff from the bag of their victim. even if some other citizen notices the ongoing theft, they'll leave it be because, again, these are huge grown up men who don't have balls to look for a useful job and they might be carrying some sort of weapon. if it's not just their sheer strength, that would be twice scarier.\n\nit was yesterday when my close friend and i went to the mall to buy some supplies. we were talking about how our holidays went and we didn't notice what kind of passengers were getting inside the jeep. our conversation reached to a point where we talked, in regular talking voice, about the said syndicate and how we're going to deal with them. i promised myself that i'll take action no matter how dangerous the situation can be. \n\nmoments before we arrive to our destination, everyone heard coins being dropped on the metal floor of the jeepney. without hesitation and confirmation, i shouted, \"hala! hulog piso!\". the jeepney, full of passengers, came to a halt and everyone's attention was on a very old lady seated on the back edge of the vehicle with old shaky wrinkled hands trying to get some spare change on the steel floor despite of a bad back and the attention drawn to her because of my misplaced sense of justice. it was so embarrassing that my friend gave me that \"you're-a-heartless-motherfucker\" look and from that moment on, we both knew we had to jolt out of the jeepney. i have never felt this bad about myself before.'\n\nNow give your output.\nSummarize:;It was a difficult experience for me to witness an old woman being treated like a beggar by the syndicates.

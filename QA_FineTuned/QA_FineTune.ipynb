Every manifestation of our life is accompanied by noise . The noise , therefore , is familiar to our ear , and has the power to conjure up life itself . Sound , alien to our life , always musical and a thing unto itself , an occasional but unnecessary element , has become to our ears what an overfamiliar face is to our eyes .

I did a load of laundry and spilled way too much detergent into the wash because of consistency. I say this because there was no smell on the clothes when removing them from the washing machine. I would spend way too much money on something that smells good and lasts. That brand promise is exciting. I do not know if this is how it is supposed to be or if in fact this is not the real product.

It took about 20 minutes. All the pieces were there, and the instructions were easy to follow. Some people had mentioned leaving the ramps off, when they put it together. I put mine on, and I have seen the cats using one to jump off the top level. I had originally thought I could just put this by the couch/window. But I ended up sectioning off part of the living room, and turned it into a cat corner. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves their cats.

{"input": "Works well and I use it for all my presentations. I also have the Logitech model, but this one has a better and solid battery door latch.

Case is very nice as well.", "refined_answer": "positive", "reference_answer": "positive"}

{"input": "I really was excited for these but unfortunately I haven't had but a month, I have only used a few times and one of them is messing up. It's choppy or statistics and then causes the earbuds to shut down and flashes red and blue. Not sure why and they came with little info. I haven't used much because they are pretty thick and don't want to stay in my ears. I read the reviews and was worried this might happen so I bought those ear buddy's to go with. But they only helped some. They still want to fall out. So I have only used a few times while at home. But as of the past week I am having a hard time getting the right one to stay on and work. Every video I played was choppy real annoying to listen to. Not sure if I should buy a replacement one or return looks like I only have till February 11th. I just didnt want to upset hubby by returning they was a gift from him. These would be awesome if just a bit smaller and of course the sound was better in the one that is messing up.", "refined_answer": "negative", "reference_answer": "negative"}

I'm happy with the hands free ability to control my music as well...much better than not being able to control my playlist at all. They're also pretty comfy and I didn't have issues with them getting wet while I worked out; nice and dry the whole time.
